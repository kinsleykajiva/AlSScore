1	1	1	1	some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar .
2	1	1	1	after reading the experiment i realized that the additional information you need to replicate the experiment is one the amount of vinegar you poured in each container two label the containers before you start war experiment and three write a conclusion to make sure war results are accurate .
3	1	1	1	what you need is more trials a control set up and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup beaker . you could also take and check the mass every min or hour .
4	1	0	0	the student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure .
5	1	2	2	for the students to be able to make a replicate they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what type of materials is needed for the experiment .
6	1	1	0	i would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers . and what are they drying into
7	1	1	0	the information i would need in order to successfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment also the materials that was used to treat the experiment . after the hours of removing the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water . making it dry for minuted might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture .
8	1	3	3	you would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment . you would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure . you would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container . you would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use plastic for example might alter the results .
9	1	3	3	some additional information you will need are the material . you also need to know the size of the container to measure how the acid rain effected it . you need to know how much vinegar is used for each sample . another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measuring the best possible way .
10	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment we will need to add information such as st iclenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass . however revisions of sentences and genuine ring will be required .
11	1	0	0	an additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
12	1	3	3	the additional information you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples . also you would need to know the kind of vinegar . in a addition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers .
13	1	2	2	there are two pieces of additional information necessary to replicate the experiment . first of all the procedure does not official specify what the four samples are . also the procedure does not specify how much vinegar to pour for each container . a good procedure would have specified this
14	1	2	2	in order the replicate the experiment you need
15	1	0	0	well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples put them in different containers that look the same put vinegar on every sample finally rinse them out with normal water let them sit for minutes till they dry . then your finally going to see the difference between those samples .
16	1	0	0	i don t know what is going on
17	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the shape of each material because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass changes the results . i would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment .
18	1	0	0	the additional information i would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain . after that i will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so i can tell and see each one is different in mass . i will organize the data to see if the information is accurate . then i will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct .
19	1	0	0	in order to replicate this experiment i would need a scare in order to get the mass . next i would need tape and markers to label the containers . last i would need all samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment .
20	1	3	3	in order for the me to replicate their procedure i would need to know what four samples they used they should include that in their procedure . also they should stay where you are to put the four containers during the hour time period finally they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment i would in as close to what they actually did and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment .
21	1	0	0	you would need to have four separate but identical containers . you would also need to pour in each of them vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them . and new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers .
22	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the mass of the four different samples how much vinegar to pour into the containers what the samples were made up of and how much water to rinse them with after the hours .
23	1	0	0	the students data needed to include how much of the solution was poured . they also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started .
24	1	3	3	for this experiments duplication you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup . you would also have to know how big in size each container was . additionally you would need to know the size of each sample to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly .
25	1	1	1	some additional information that i would need is the amount of vinegar they poured .
26	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what type of vinegar they were using because it could of been any type what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been different sizes and they wouldn t have valid results and they also should have told me what they were holding constant because i wouldn t know what variables to use or control .
27	1	2	2	they needed to include what time they started and when they ended . also the amount of vinegar they used . also the size of each sample .
28	1	0	0	. get different samples marble limestone wood plastic . p . put each sample into different containers . p . pour vinegar in each of separate but identical containers . p . after hours remove the samples from the container and rinse each w distilled water . p . allow samples to sit and dry for min . p . determine the data of each sample . p . record your data .
29	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were . in this group s procedure they do not state what
30	1	2	0	in step three you would need to know how much of each sample to use . also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step you must rinse each stone as much . also there is no control variable .
31	1	2	2	i additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for hours . another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable . i would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each separate but identical container .
32	1	0	0	you will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dried up .
33	1	3	3	for this experiment you would actually need to know what each sample is the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each sample
34	1	3	3	to replicate the experiment i would need to know the samples that i will be using . i would also need to know how much vinegar to use . i would also need to know what type of containers to use .
35	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment . you would need to know how much vinegar to pour you need to know how much distilled water and you as need to know how your going to weigh it .
36	1	2	2	well i would need to know what the problem statement is . i would need to know what type of cups we are using . i would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using . and i would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ .
37	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material . although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure .
38	1	0	0	i will need to know what s the purpose for this experiment know the difference in mass for each sample and i need to know an estimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was .
39	1	1	1	they should add how much vinegar to add to each sample . for this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water .
40	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know first how to calculate the mass of the samples . i would also need t o know what the four samples are as if is not stated in the procedure . lastly to repeat this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container .
41	1	1	1	additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment what materials are going to be used and how much of each material will be used
42	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container . you also need to know what to be of containers to pour the vinegar in . also you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water .
43	1	3	3	after reading the procedure i would first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distilled water .
44	1	3	3	determine what the different samples are then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample . state how long you are rising the materials in water . ex minutes
45	1	2	2	in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need a lot of additional information . first of all i would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples rocks bark
46	1	0	0	i think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups . for instance they could say each of the cork samples and place sample into cup labeled a
47	1	2	2	one extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers . the words a sample doesn t specify the exact amount of each rock are needed . a repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results .
48	1	0	0	there could be more than test for each sample . there could also have a constant added to the experiment . also there are to softy ins teachings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
49	1	0	0	they should take more notes that way in case they mess up they can have a the information how to redo it .
50	1	3	2	how much vinegar should you pour with what label and when to sit it it stand dry for min . . . label . the container s repeatedly separate but identical containers . what containers should we use
51	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the different materials were . i would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was .
52	1	0	0	in the experiment i would determine the mas of each sample pair the vinegar into a container then label . i would wait hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water . let the samples dry and find the mass difference
53	1	2	2	in order to complete this experiment three additional thing should be included . the first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup . the second is to list the far samples in the procedure . the third is to record the information obtained .
54	1	2	2	in order to replicate the group s i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long containers how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples .
55	1	2	2	the procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using marbles limestone wood plastic . you need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup . you need a set amount . you could also do the time at different times . so you could do it at is at and at minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time .
56	1	1	0	the information i would need to replicate the experiment is the four different samples the four identical containers the amount of time to let the samples sit and the product to rinse the samples with so i could let them sit for more .
57	1	0	0	to repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass .
58	1	2	2	we need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container to make sure that each sample fair results . we also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable . we also need to know what kind and how big the containers are because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes .
59	1	3	3	some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in . also in step it says add a sample of each material . we need to know how big the sample would have to be . something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in is it room temperature we need to know this .
60	1	3	3	to replicate the experiment the procedure would require more detail . one piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment . it is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the hours . finally the procedure needs to include details about the experiment for example if the whole sample must be submerged .
61	1	1	1	you would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps . that because the experiment only tell you to pour vinegar but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put .
62	1	3	3	this group left same very important thing out of their procedure . first of all they didn t tell us what samples to use for the experiment . they didn t tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab .
63	1	1	1	you would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data . write down you need to record the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass .
64	1	0	0	some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used . also when they say place a sample of the material how much of each type am i going to need .
65	1	0	0	first of all you ll need to measure the container bits ls and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don t accident have extra weight . calculate the time difference it took to prepare them . use the same weight of each sample .
66	1	0	0	to exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know how they measured the mass of the object because without that how would we figure out the different masses . we have to know the starting mass the ending mass and the difference in mass .
67	1	1	1	after reading the group procedure i did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers . this group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar . this group also did not state the reason the data they just said to determine it .
68	1	2	2	i would need the amount of rich in each container . i would need the amount of vinegar of r container . i would need the same kind of vinegar in each container . i would need all of this additional information to replicate this reprimand . i would also need the amount trials done .
69	1	3	3	. a list of materials and safety requirements . p . the amount of vinegar to put in the containers . p . the temperature of the room vinegar p . a control group .
70	1	1	1	additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group . a control gray should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources . also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample . we also would need to know .
71	1	1	1	what you would need is the information on how much vinegar is added to every sample . for example one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar . so that can throw their ending masses off .
72	1	2	2	we would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say samples . we need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with . they would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams .
73	1	0	0	what the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples . so what i would do what they did in the beginning or the investigation i would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples .
74	1	1	1	on statement they need to put the measurement of the containers p on stamen how much water p on number whats the measure mt were support to use for the mass .
75	1	1	1	some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container . also make sure the times are all on for each sample . also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass .
76	1	3	3	in order to replicate ta experiment a person would need to know a few more things . they would need to know which substances to use how much of each one . the person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container . they would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in . one might also want to know what type of container how to write down the findings .
77	1	3	3	you would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container . what type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment .
78	1	0	0	additional pieces of information that should be included in the procedure would be with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale have the controlled variable evident in the procedure one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass the ending mass and the difference in mass using grams .
79	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container . you would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples . also you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same .
80	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know more things that weren t stated in the procedure . i would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off .
81	1	3	3	the additional things that i would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in . i would also include the samples of what i am testing in the experiment . lastly i would also put in my procedure how much amount of vinegar they are putting in .
82	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment you must be able to know what the four materials are how to measure the mass how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with . they should start by saying d determine the mass put the triple beam balance of the four riff . samples name them then pour vinegar how much into containers then these step of step wash how much distilled water and it would be better .
83	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass for example triple beam balance etc and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers .
84	1	0	0	you got to put more vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more vinegar so it could do more reaction .
85	1	1	1	another trials the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it s accurate . because if not quill change the experiment . by changing the most important things .
86	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure . first we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers enough to cover them next we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material . will we completely submerge it or only partially finally we need to know which materials to use . the data indicates them but the procedure does not .
87	1	0	0	three additional pieces of information i would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials use a control and when it s finish to record the data .
88	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more pieces of information . one of them being the amount of each material wood plastic marble and limestone . you would also need to know how much vinegar to add . finally a constant for each material would also help .
89	1	0	0	the independent variable is the marble limestone wood plastic . the marble starting point was . g . the limestone was . g and wood starting point . . the end of the experiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample .
90	1	2	2	additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using . secondly in the procedures i made need to what to weigh the mass in for example they didn t tell you to weigh in grams and i wouldn t be able to complete the experiment easily . it doesn t tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate i would need to know that .
91	1	3	3	i think that knowing the temperature in the enjoyment would be very useful i m sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples we wouldn t get the same results . also we need to know what type of environment we should place this in . should it be sunny dark windy hot cold etc . i also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be we don t even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples . this experiment is missing too much information .
92	1	0	0	in order for i for replicate this experiment i would need to know what are the research ing with this experiment what kind of result are being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of experiment there results .
93	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . you would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water . you would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in .
94	1	1	2	in order to replicate the experiment we would need a control . we would also need the four samples to use . and another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one . that is what we would need to replicate the experiment .
95	1	3	1	the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container . the amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid . the results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vinegar was increased or decreased . therefore the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
96	1	0	0	in order to replicate this groups procedure you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure . also to ma he it more clear they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose .
97	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment the procedure would have to add more details . in the first bullet the four samples should be stated as marble limestone wood and plastic . you should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need . there should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment . also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added . one last thing is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say in grams .
98	1	1	1	they should have told the samples that was used . the second thing was the outcome what happened to the differ .
99	1	3	3	the students need to say what the samples are . they need to
100	1	2	2	the group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control . also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply conclusion . the recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment .
101	1	3	3	additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples . in step i would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container . also in step i would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long .
102	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment some additional information i would need is how the gap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so . i would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used .
103	1	1	1	first off these groups of students forgot to add in step how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container . in step number the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different marble limestone wood plastic . the students also forgot to include step which is find the differences in mass . if another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn t know what they are comparing .
104	1	2	2	if i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp . of the room i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used .
105	1	0	2	after reading the groups procedure the following additional information is needed you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp .
106	1	1	1	the additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut . also you need to record all the information . they need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after hours .
107	1	2	3	you would need the size of the container amount of vinegar used the types of samples . such as earth wood limestone and plastic and how much of each to put in .
108	1	3	3	in addition to the information given you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container different amounts could change the results . there should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at because change in temperature can affect the corrosion process . in the experiment it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size .
109	1	1	1	additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measure cents of the liquids poured into the cups . also was size cups are the liquids poured into . in the procedure it says pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers . that is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
110	1	0	0	some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put in the vinegar .
111	1	0	0	for each box they should have done it times so they would have an average .
112	1	1	1	i would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment . what should i be looking for when experiment is going on how do i determine the mas of each segment .
113	1	1	1	some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure include what type of samples your using also do explain why you are using vinegar . finally to tell the reader what your weighing with and why .
114	1	2	2	if i was to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container the size of the containers and what was used to weigh the samples .
115	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc .
116	1	0	0	in order to replicate this this experiment you would need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass .
117	1	2	3	you would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the samples you don t pour the vinegar in instead you say to drops in each container . you want everything to be the same and when you pour you don t always get the exact amount for each container . also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar .
118	1	0	0	your going to need how much is there in total .
119	1	0	0	pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers . p place one sample in a containers and do the same for the rest p after hours remove sample and rinse p sit and dry for min . p determine the miles .
120	1	2	3	to replicate this experiment you would need to know the mass amount of vinegar used in each cup . it is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in . a different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup . the last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment . the volume of the cup and or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment .
121	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment i would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared i would also be more specific on the word samples to describe rocks and stones . and most importantly i would make a control i would put marble limestone wood and plastic in water .
122	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need some additional information . first of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container . second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar .
123	1	1	2	what you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup . also you would need to list the materials you were using . another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use .
124	1	1	1	you would need what samples there what you do after number .
125	1	0	0	it would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data . also a total of the data could have been better too .
126	1	3	3	first you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about . next you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put in each container . you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample .
127	1	0	0	the additional information i would need to eradicate the experiment i would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment . i would put after hours remove the samples from the container rinse each sample w distilled water . allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes . instead of putting determine the mass of each sample . i would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out .
128	1	0	0	i will need to add on them sub ten by how many number their are . the sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight .
129	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment a control would need to be established . also a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment . in order to accurately replicate this experiment it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the hours .
130	1	3	3	we would word correct safety measures to take the control the effect of vinegar what temperature to store them at what the identical containers are made of and its size what type of scale to use to mean it the amount of vinegar in each container i more trials
131	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment there are a few more things i need to know . the problem does not state what the four different samples are . second i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup . the amount of vinegar could impact the mass . last i would need to where to store the samples for the hour period . different temperatures might affect the different samples .
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the containers the amount of vinegar poured in each cup .
133	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
134	1	0	0	you would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment or not using enough or too much may not give you the same results .
135	1	3	3	in order to replicate the lab the students did you would need to know what materials were need . what kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples .
136	1	2	3	the additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used . also they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results . lastly it should include the size of the container because it could have a different result .
137	1	2	1	additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step what the samples are going to be . it would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar . it would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples . it would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test .
138	1	3	3	after reading the group s procedure additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in for they need to be identical . u also need to know that amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain the same starting mass the group of students received from the samples . another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the old example of the experiment . another good price of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight .
139	1	3	3	some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit . such as in the sun or in the refrigerator . how much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using
140	1	2	2	the students should say in the experiment what samples are being used . they should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup .
141	1	2	2	three additional pieces of information that i would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of how much vinegar to pour into each container and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was . also how much distilled water i would need to use .
142	1	2	2	in the procedure i would also need to know how much vinegar to use which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is .
143	1	3	2	in order to complete this experiment you would need additional information . you would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment . you would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors . you might also need to know to know the constants . what type of vinegar and what time you started .
144	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment you would also need to know vinegar they used the size of the cup and the the size of the samples .
145	1	2	2	after reading the procedure there were a few things i need to know to replicate the experiment . one thing is the amount of vinegar used . another is how much water to use when rinsing it . the last thing is how to store the samples for hours . there were a few problems with this procedure .
146	1	3	3	i would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not it would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into .
147	1	1	1	i need to know how big the container is how many of them .
148	1	2	2	what are the samples what is the material use how much vinegar is poured in the containers .
149	1	0	0	the students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen . also they should have stated what they were investigating . they should have made a conclusion from the results .
150	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers what tools to use such as safety goggles and having more trials .
151	1	1	1	they needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined they need to tell you to table the containers and you need to record tour data .
152	1	2	1	some additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do i put in each container . also what am i supposed to label the container i m not quite sure how to measure the mass by using a scale . if so the same scale for each sample . also how big are the samples supposed to be .
153	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup the temperature of the surroundings and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale .
154	1	0	0	to replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid .
155	1	2	3	you would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container . i think the students should have started out with the same mass . what type of vinegar and does temperature matters .
156	1	0	0	some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar . also maybe not have then sit for hours but had then sit less . they could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water .
157	1	2	2	the additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are p . the amount of vinegar to pour this must remain constant in a credible experiment . p . the types of samples used should be in the procedure . p .
158	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers . we know that marble lost grams limestone lost . grams plastic lost grams and wood stayed the same but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample .
159	1	0	0	we had all the information we need to do the experiment we already know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would ve explained it better to be able to complete the mass because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass .
160	1	2	2	the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment . you d also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container .
161	1	1	1	to replicate the groups procedure i would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers how much of one sample material do they want and how they want us to determine the mass .
162	1	1	1	there are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately . in procedure it does not say to measure the mass of the samples i or without a petra dish . it also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument such as balance beam . another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need because if one gets more than another it might change the weight and how much water prince the samples with .
163	1	1	1	you would need to tell what type of samples they are . also what type of utensil to use to measure the mass of the samples . also would need repeat or replicating trials to re test the experiment . or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment you ll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results .
164	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of samples i am using . the group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are . also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample i should measure . again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible to know how much of the sample i should be using . finally in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i should add to each sample . different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently making the experiment inaccurate .
165	1	2	2	in order to be able to duplicate this experiment you need the following information how much vinegar to use . also how big are the containers i . e what is what is their volume . and lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers .
166	1	1	1	additional information i would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample . this is because if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would .
167	1	0	0	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to state exactly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour . in most cases it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be sufficient .
168	1	3	3	to repeat this experiment i would need to know the four different samples without knowing that i don t know what i m testing . i also need to know how much vinegar in each of the cups . i would need to know where to put all of the different containers . i don t know if they need to stay at room temp cold or not .
169	1	0	0	you should repeat each step in the experiment . start with step and go all the way to step .
170	1	1	1	to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers . you would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment .
171	1	1	0	what materials should we use because in order to do this experiment it has to tell us what substances are being used . their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight .
172	1	2	2	after reading the group s procedure in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container the more densely packed the samples are . i would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments .
173	1	1	0	the procedure has to be more specific . it should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end . it should have materials listed . it should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material .
174	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used because i could have chosen metal cardboard and many other sample materials that they didn t use and would get different results . also i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can cause a major change . lastly they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for minutes because if they are sitting in room temp . or by a light source makes a difference too .
175	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment they would need to tell you how much vinegar to put in the cups have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment .
176	1	2	2	to replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples .
177	1	2	2	these students procedure was not a reliable one . the material needed to mention what kind of material they uses . is there only reducing to ism the sample . they also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup . the material also that not include in control groups . which is a centered post or any experiment . they student variable unchecked . they also included only the trial .
178	1	1	1	i would need to know the amount of vinegar added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment .
179	1	2	3	the additional information i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using . in step it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples but doesn t tell me which kind . in step it tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn t tell me what size or type of container . after sample are removed from the containers after hours i need to find the mass of each sample . step but they don t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slur hf .
180	1	1	1	the group needs to add what to label because
181	1	0	1	first i would say you need to get all materials before you do any of that . what would we use to get the masses of the different materials and where would we place the containers while we are waiting for the results .
182	1	3	3	first you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers . you would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of . lastly they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun in a dry cold place etc .
183	1	2	2	in step we need to know what samples . it should list the types of rock . p in step how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given . p in step it should say to correct the new mass of each sample .
184	1	1	1	the procedure is not clear they need to say the sample names because we don t know what it is . also they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar . finally they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results .
185	1	0	0	we would need observations during the whole experiment maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed . also try another sample .
186	1	2	2	the experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure . for example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described . the method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials has not been specified in the procedural information .
187	1	1	1	. i would have to know what kind of area i would have to leave it in for hours . temperature p . i would have to know what kind of wood to use if there has any specific . p . also in step it does not say what i have to use to determine the mass of the rocks plastic and wood .
188	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment you need to know what the samples are taken of what size the samples should be what size the containers should be and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample .
189	1	0	0	in this group s procedure some additional information should ve been what were the labels named .
190	1	2	2	additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar . you would also need to know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use .
191	1	0	0	in order to replicate the experiment i believe that the information wanted would be the starting rows ending mass and difference in mass . the additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure . i f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
192	1	0	0	i think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph .
193	1	0	0	in the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone rock plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them . they could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one marble limestone wood and plastic . in the procedure it only explained after hours but they didn t write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time .
194	1	1	1	after reading the groups procedure i found more additional pieces of inform otis so that i can duplicate the experiments . i need to know the independent variable dependent variable and how much vinegar to pour into each separate containers .
195	1	3	3	after reading that group s procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were . another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample . the last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be .
196	1	3	3	the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample in order to find the mass of only the sample you need to subtract the mass of the container . also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample . i also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when i am waiting hours . lastly i need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react .
197	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment the person performing it should do a few things differently . first they should state what materials they are using second they should have a set measurement of how much vinegar to pour into each container and third they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses .
198	1	1	1	need to know how much vinegar to put in each container how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure .
199	1	3	3	to replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used . you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water . the size of the container would be essential as well so you would know how much vinegar should be used .
200	1	0	0	additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials to find out what the starting mass was to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass .
201	1	0	0	you would need more marble limestone wood and plastic .
202	1	1	1	you would need the amount of vinegar the samples sat in . the amount of water they where rinsed in and the amount of each sample .
203	1	0	0	i don t know what replicate means so i don t know how to answer this question
204	1	3	3	first it doesn t tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers . next it doesn t say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes maybe they need a cover for it but we don t know from this information . in addition there is an information about how they determined the mass .
205	1	2	2	in the group s procedure three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the hours .
206	1	3	3	. what kind of sample of material are you using . . how much vinegar should we put in the containers . . they should be more clear about how to rinse each sample .
207	1	2	2	i need to know how much vinegar . i need to pour on each of pour separate but identical containers . i need to know what the four different samples are .
208	1	0	0	in order to replicate experiment acid rain you will need get four separate but identical containers the materials marble limestone wood and plastic . after you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container after you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container . after hours rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again .
209	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container . also i would need to know of each sample was are solid piece or n small or pieces . the great would need to identify
210	1	1	1	they would have to add put each four different sample in four separate but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar . butter have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers .
211	1	3	3	the procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment . there should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup . the group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a per a sink pieces could chip off decreasing the mass . the group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size .
212	1	0	0	tools .
213	1	2	2	a desirable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment . the it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not and how much vinegar to use .
214	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are . the experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without . the experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain . that may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab . also the lab should have said what type of container whether it is a beaker test tube or a different type of container .
215	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to . i would need to also know which type of container to use .
216	1	2	2	one piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure . they repeat over and over about different samples but never once tell you what they were . the second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample . finally the rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used .
217	1	1	1	the additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do i leave the containers after i finish putting all the samples into different containers .
218	1	1	1	additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass what are the samples marble limestone wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass .
219	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers how long to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water . i think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass therefore ruining the experiment . also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass . so i would our water in different containers and do the same thing .
220	1	0	1	the group would need to put in the materials more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure .
221	1	2	2	the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is how many ml of vinegar are poured to each four separate containers not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled and what are the four different samples these are information s i need to replicate the procedure .
222	1	2	2	the first thing is why the students are doing this experiment . then the second piece of information is the amount of vinegar put in each container . the student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample . finally their should be a conclusion and a list of materials .
223	1	1	1	first they should of put the amount of vinegar being used . they don t say to record there data .
224	1	2	2	additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following p . explain what the four different samples would be . p . explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup . p . another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples . p . indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples .
225	1	0	0	i
226	1	1	1	in order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used . in this experiment they used marble limestone wood plastic . the second step is to find the mass of the four samples . then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment . that how i would do this experiment over .
227	1	1	1	we would need to know what the investigation was need to know what kind of sample their talking about . what they used to determine the mass . all of this information will help the reader help understand the investigation better .
228	1	3	2	you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers what order to put samples in take them out allay once and how long to rinse for .
229	1	2	2	you would need to know how much vinegar was used how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used .
230	1	0	0	the students still need to make a hypothesis a graph and find the difference in mass .
231	1	2	2	one piece of information i would need to know in order to replicate the group s procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar filled container . i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container . i would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples . if i used different amounts of water when washing the samples one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results .
232	1	2	2	some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar do we pour into the containers how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water .
233	1	0	0	you need limestone and marble .
234	1	1	1	the information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for minutes does it have to dry in a cool area what type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for min what happens after you determine the mass
235	1	0	0	in order to rest this experiment they could have multiple trial . and also kept the lab going for hours in place as they also need ti have a tv and do content . they also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
236	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment i need to know the materials what kind of sample material and why are they doing the experiment . how much vinegar rinse or how long
237	1	0	0	determine the ending mass determine the difference in mass . also the mass or everything marble limestone wood and plastic . you would need to add up all three masses starting ending and the difference in mass then you will get the answer to all of them .
238	1	1	2	the steps that this procedure is missing would be to list gather all materials because you need to know what you are working with nd say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is missing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with . if you don t have this information it would make the experiment very off with validity s . the containers wouldn t be the same .
239	1	3	3	the group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made limestone wood plastic instead of just saying different samples . they also say determine the mass of that substances but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass scale . they need to say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used . lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with and how .
240	1	2	2	you would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples . also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate . finally you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples what instrument to use .
241	1	3	3	to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step . in step a person would need to know the temperature the samples are waiting hours in . in step the procedure states a sample of one material unless the materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure the actual names of each of the materials should be given . temperature for step would also be good additional info as well .
242	1	2	2	i would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container . what four types of materials we need for the experiment to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment .
243	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment . these are three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment .
244	1	2	2	some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in . another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container . another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it .
245	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things . one thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment . i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers . lastly i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples .
246	1	0	0	the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample the limestone sample and the wood sample and the plastic sample . i would follow the procedure step by step .
247	1	1	1	additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting . including writing down the data in the experiment . make step to separate steps . also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass . another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers .
248	1	1	1	first you would need a control . the absence of what is effecting the dependant . in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar . this group had don t write down the amount of vinegar . its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment . they should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable .
249	1	2	2	there is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment . i need to know what the four starting samples are . also this procedure needs to include weigh the samples . i need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample . lastly at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight .
250	1	1	1	three additional peace of information you need is what type of vinegar and at what ph . also the lb of the samples .
251	1	0	1	you would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment . also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion .
252	1	3	3	they need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after hours .
253	1	1	1	what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup . however including information about time wouldn t hart the icon t either .
254	1	3	3	. firstly the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are how big they are what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment p . the group does not explain how much vinegar should be poorer into the container how much is needed p . the group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container . even though this is just vinegar their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab . goggle inclusion would also be rise .
255	1	2	2	the procedure should include what samples they are testing . they need to include the amount of vinegar in each up in metric format . the way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed separately .
256	1	3	3	additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container . how long do you rinse the samples do the samples stay outside or inside day or night
257	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information what are four samples you would need to know that so the experiment will be the same . they should also include the amount of vinegar that you need . the last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container
258	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers . also i would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment . and finally i need to know if it is weighed in grams pounds or any other measurement .
259	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers . you would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container . the last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time .
260	1	2	2	the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment the amount of vinegar to put in the containers the different samples they used needs to be stated in procedures and the amount of the sample placed in the container .
261	1	0	0	you would need to add observations you would also need to add the time on the table .
262	1	0	0	the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers . you would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar . you will also need to have containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container .
263	1	0	0	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water .
264	1	0	0	in order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble limestone wood and the plastic . pour the vinegar into their containers . place the materials into the containers and wait hours . may be the mass will be different may be it will be the same .
265	1	3	3	there is some additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment first i would need to know what the four different samples are . second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the containers . third i would need to know what type of container i should use . last i would need to know where to keep the containers during the hours . these are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment .
266	1	1	1	the other information i would need to replicate this experiment is what do we use for the samples how much each samples do we use and how do we determine the mass of each sample
267	1	1	1	after reading this group s procedure i found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup . this information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure could t be replicated . therefore it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment .
268	1	1	0	the first thing that i would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment is my different samples . the next thing i will need is the vinegar to pour on our samples the last thing i need is a place al to measure the start mass g and the ending mass g to find out the difference in mass g .
269	1	0	0	i guess follow the steps to make the experiment is right like allow to dry in min . let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers . go over to make sure nothing goes wrong .
270	1	3	3	the students need to include what the samples were . you can t do an experiment if you don t know what you re testing on . the students should also include the temp . that the containers were stored at for hours . lastly they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container . they could ve put the same amount or different amount . they could ve put little or a lot .
271	1	2	0	the addition information that i would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data . what is the best container to put the sample in and does it have to be the same kind of container . i would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample .
272	1	1	3	in order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the ph of the vinegar how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used ie . balsa wood compared with pine or type or type of plastic .
273	1	1	2	to replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use you need to know how large the samples are and you need to know why you are doing the experiment .
274	1	1	1	if trying to replicate this experiment you would need more information . you need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers . you will also need to know what to label your container . how do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment you need to make sure that you have all of the correct information before starting your project .
275	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the materials your using . this procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar .
276	1	1	1	the students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples . they also didn t specify how much of each sample . they also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went .
277	1	2	2	some additional information that s needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names kinds of each sample the measurements of each sample poured into the containers and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well .
278	1	1	1	some information that is missing that they don t say what size of containers and they don t say what to do with data .
279	1	1	1	in order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used and if it is the same for all of them . you would also need to do another trial as the extra information would validate the experiment more .
280	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar is being poured in . i would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples . lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container weather or not all of it or half of it should be added .
281	1	3	3	to tell the amount vinegar you pour into the container the size of the container ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water . how many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass .
282	1	1	1	this procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials . first it has to say to put on their eye protection . it also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples . lastly there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results .
283	1	0	0	say what you are trying figure out in the first place . p it s not enough into figure out what is going on . p we need to know more clearly how to do each step .
284	1	1	0	first i would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need . a hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out .
285	1	1	1	in order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup . they also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed . if there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid .
286	1	2	2	they did not tell us what to measure with they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers .
287	1	2	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would also need materials i would use . i would need the amount of vinegar in the container and i would also need time limit to do the test .
288	1	0	0	some information i would need to know is how would the water be if
289	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment i would need to know more information . i would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen . also i don t know how much vinegar to pore in each cup . this procedure also should specify what materials to use line what brand of cups or size .
290	1	1	1	the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four separate containers . they also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample .
291	1	3	3	first they should list the samples they used . marble limestone wood and plastic in their procedure . they should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect . they should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet as a refrigerator or something . not just leaving it out of their processes .
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp . by hour bic it s recorded after a war period . you would also need to know the mass before it was left to any for minutes .
293	1	1	1	to add to the experiment design the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables . following this you will
294	1	1	1	additions information that would be good to now is why are the students performing this xpirement why arent there cups a for measures for distilled water amounts or vinegar amounts you should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same .
295	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar i would get different results .
296	1	0	0	you will need more mass and you have to dry it for minutes . after hours remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water . you will probably need more of a little bit of everything .
297	1	1	1	the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass which would be a triple beam balance . you would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step . you would also need to know what the samples you are testing are . those samples would be marble limestone wood and plastic .
298	1	2	2	in order to replicate the group s experiment i would need the following information what the samples are how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample .
299	1	1	1	the information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis . secondly they need to list all objects they used lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was wasn t correct .
300	1	1	1	the group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control . in the experiment procedure also doesn t put the different samples of four like marble limestone wood plastic the purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time .
301	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment you would need to know the size of the containers the amount of each material to start with and the amount of vinegar used .
302	1	3	3	i would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container . how long to rinse it in water materials . and what kind of container ca social use .
303	1	3	2	in order to replicate this experiment you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the hours what type of climate .
304	1	1	1	to duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is identical making it move accurate .
305	1	2	2	the additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific different samples . i also need to know how much vinegar is needed . furthermore i need to know the amount of each sample needed . finally this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample .
306	1	0	0	to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time .
307	1	2	2	their are three things wrong with this procedure . one is they did not table the four identical containers the second is they need to tell how much vinegar is needed . the third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water .
308	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control . also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers . lastly i would have all of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed .
309	1	2	3	one piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container . another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit . and lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark .
310	1	0	0	you will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container . after the hours is over remove samples and rinse . have the samples sit and dry for min .
311	1	2	2	additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled .
312	1	1	2	you would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass and the information to which material to use in step .
313	1	3	3	three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment . first is how much vinegar should be allowed to each individual cup as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples . the next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not . third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the hour wait period . should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment .
314	1	1	1	this experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same .
315	1	0	0	the information the students left out was the control . the control of the experiment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affected the samples .
316	1	1	1	additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar . also the experiment doesn t say how to remove the materials from the vinegar .
317	1	0	0	after reading this procedure i think it would need task needed . tell what it is you are doing and what solution and a hypothesis .
318	1	1	0	the first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i . e the procedure to gather materials . this lets people know what materials your using . also this procedure wasn t worded clearly . like pour vinegar into separate but identical containers . that makes no sense and is hard to understand . they also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples .
319	1	2	2	the additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used .
320	1	1	0	they didn t include the temperature of the containers . they didn t have trials of testing .
321	1	2	2	you would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry .
322	1	3	3	the group should be more specific including the names of the samples add rain sample etc . . they should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step . in step they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container .
323	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass . also i need to know what should i do with the containers once i ve labeled them . the experiment s results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them you don t know what to do . lastly how much water should i rinse the samples with if different amounts are used the weight could differ .
324	1	2	2	if i a just looking at the people and i was to repeat this experiment i would need to know what the four different samples were does the distilled water need to be a after temperature and how much vinegar do i add to the samples .
325	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use . the procedure is very vague . a scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment . therefore the students should specify the marble limestone wood plastic . they should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used .
326	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment the mass of different samples should be held constant there should be a control group . the experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed and if it was rinsed with cold hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature they were kept at . also what was the group investigating in should be included .
327	1	3	3	how much vinegar you pour into the cups . what kind of vinegar you use . what kind of containers you should use .
328	1	2	2	to make this procedure repeatable we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with . otherwise we couldn t even start the experiment . we would also need to know how much vinegar in ml to pour in the cups .
329	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment i would need additional information . for example how much vinegar should be poured into each container i would also want to know the size of each sample and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible . lastly i would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with . with this information i am certainly capable of repeating the experiment .
330	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure i was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring . all they tell us is vinegar . also what is the size of the containers how much of each sample is being poured into the container the group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment .
331	1	0	0	i think from reading the procedure they should ve added information describing the look before and after see if there were any physical changes . if something was to change then the group should ve got it down so we know the features of the items .
332	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure to replicate this experiment i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are accurate . they would also need to include the four samples names marble limestone wood and plastic . so i know what everything what everything is so i can create a data table . they would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances i would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in .
333	1	0	0	more information is needed more steps because its not enough to drew a conclusion . not many materials are listed .
334	1	0	0	pieces of information i would include to replicate the procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container let samples sit and dry for min and leave samples for hours . i choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment .
335	1	1	1	i would still want to know what they were doing this experiment how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples .
336	1	1	1	in order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each . also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research .
337	1	3	3	you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so that you wouldn t use a stronger or weaker ph level . you would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant .
338	1	0	0	the additional information you need to replace the experiment . you need limestone wood and plastic marbles . you test all of them in different containers . it will give you the mass of the experiment . that is what it need to replace the experiment .
339	1	0	0	how much of the material did they put into each container . was there a controlled part of this experiment . did they conduct a graph for this experiment .
340	1	1	1	i would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure .
341	1	3	3	in the procedure it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample . finally additional information that should be added would be telling where to keep these samples where it s cold room or hot temperature .
342	1	3	3	how much vinegar would you pour in each cup . what temperature would the samples be in would it be the same or would it be different how would also need to know if they used the same size cup . these things are all very important information that wasn t included .
343	1	3	2	the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers do they want us to use you would need a sample of each of the substances . as well as knowing what type of each substance you need . last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers which changes the mass of each sample .
344	1	3	3	some additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar size of the containers and the temperature .
345	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known . also the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated . all of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment .
346	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment more information is needed . for example there has to be clear statement of problem . this procedure doesn t explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples . also there has to be information on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment .
347	1	1	1	the additional information it would need would be the
348	1	0	0	to replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with . you will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what you can know what you have to do .
349	1	2	2	some information that could be added could be temperature of the vinegar or water you could also add how much vinegar you add another thing to add would be a list of possible samples .
350	1	1	0	something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials . this insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start . second make the sets easier to understand step is very hard to interpret . lastly make sure you clean up them at the end .
351	1	2	3	first i would need to know what they used to determine the mass . it would also be helpful if they put the different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure . in case there was no data table present . they could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them . so i would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter . i would also need to no how much of each material to use .
352	1	0	0	i believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
353	1	0	0	to replicate their experiment i would need to have take their their procedure and use them . i would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment . all these need are the true basic s .
354	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn t receive the treatment and in this case didn t receive the vinegar needs to be more clear . it says pour vinegar into a container but it s not specific as to how much vinegar . also how much of the sample that will be used isn t stated .
355	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you should distribute into the container how long you should run theater on it for rinsing how much of the each material you need .
356	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material samples were marble limestone acid and plastic . you would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams . if these three were added to the procedure then you could replicate the experiment .
357	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample .
358	1	0	0	to me i think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working .
359	1	3	3	i would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as ml . where do i put the cups in the sun or ref rid after where do i let the samples dry in the open or the outside .
360	1	1	1	after reading the group s procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples then pour vinegar in a container and after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water . in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples .
361	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container how much distilled water each sample was washed with and the size of the containers .
362	1	3	3	after reading the group procedure the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure how much vinegar should i pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface we would have more contact with the vinegar ending it right and the mass of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need know how much of each sample was used .
363	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container . it would also put what effect of materials its going to use .
364	1	3	3	in order to replicate this procedures you would need to know
365	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were . also step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific . they might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate .
366	1	2	2	addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers . another thing that would be needed is the types of racks because the gap didn t specify the different samples in the procedure the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after for example they could have said to measure it in grams .
367	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment after reading you will need to know what the different samples are . you will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container . you will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the hours .
368	1	0	0	additional information would be doing the experiment times before putting the data down .
369	1	2	2	i would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers what kind of lime and plastic like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in .
370	1	2	2	some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples how much vinegar do you have to pour into each container . and how many trials are needed to get more accurate data . we need those information to know how to do this experiment .
371	1	0	0	my opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the samples and the procedure presents the table .
372	1	0	0	you need to repeat the the experiment more time record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change . also background information is important to any experiment .
373	1	1	1	in order to repeat this lab exactly as they did i would need to know what materials i d need for example the marble wood limestone plastic was not write in the procedure .
374	1	0	0	in order for you to replicate the experiment you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome . also in step where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything . lastly i would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer .
375	1	1	1	in this procedure the group calls the materials samples instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart . when they just say samples that can mean anything . in step number one they should say why you need to determine the mass of the four materials .
376	1	0	0	after you determine the mass of the products go back and see of your these was correct . then go and eight a lab report about v . then when your done hand it in .
377	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment for acid rain you need additional information . first you need to know what type of samples your using . second the procedure did not specify how big each samples should be . having different sizes might change the results . lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water you should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results .
378	1	2	2	the additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples . also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in whether this was the same for each sample . these additional steps details would help create accuracy consistency for all who completed the experiment .
379	1	1	1	i think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be anther is they didn t put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses .
380	1	1	1	some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar . in order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it . you also have to do some math to get the difference in mass .
381	1	2	2	to repeat in experiment doing the group procedure i would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container . another information
382	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup . i would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation must be better explained .
383	1	2	3	i would need to know how much samples i need for this experiment . i would need to know how much vinegar i am pouring into each container . also i would need to know if i am letting the samples dry in the sun or not . without these i could not replicate this experiment .
384	1	2	2	i would need to know how much vinegar was used how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass .
385	1	0	0	more you could repeat the experiment just see it .
386	1	1	1	first the experiment needs to have a control . they need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials . second they need more than one trial for each material . i suggest three so you receive better data . the third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample .
387	1	0	0	the limestone have mass than all of them .
388	1	0	0	you would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar distilled water and some other materials .
389	1	2	3	in order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . you would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same . finally you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the hours .
390	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for . we would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup . we would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying . and we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar .
391	1	2	2	we would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup . also we would need to know how much or each sample to use and which materials . we would also need a control . so would need to place something in regular water as well .
392	1	1	1	this experiment didn t have a control and the grape didn t do multiple trifles . you would also may need to know what temperature the rome is .
393	1	3	2	you will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample . also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them .
394	1	1	1	some additional information that needed in this experiment acid rain would be explain more in detail about how to use the steps ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differ ways . this experiment enoch be more cleared and you should include a grayish . this experiment doesnt make a whole lot of see five .
395	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used . also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated . lastly the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included .
396	1	0	0	to replicate this experiment you will need the following vinegar to your in each identical container you will need to let the sample sit and dry for minutes . after hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water .
397	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers .
398	1	2	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container where they stored the containers for hours and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for minutes .
399	1	2	2	some additional information would include the amount of vinegar poured into each container mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the containers were stored for the hours .
400	1	2	2	the procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it . also you do not know what the four samples are . in the second step how much vinegar should be poured . in the that step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable . a last step should also be included to say repeat .
401	1	1	2	after reading the procedure i would need to know the materials the students are using . i would also need to know why they are doing the experiment what is the purpose what kind of containers are they using and how big are they
402	1	2	2	additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured into each container where the containers are stored or kept for hours how the samples should be dried and lastly with what should the masses be taken on .
403	1	0	0	for one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure . they also should state to use the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate . finally the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment .
404	1	0	0	you would need to state that wood didn t lose any mass the plastic lost of mass the marble lost of mass and the limestone lost . mass . then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass .
405	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included . one thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container . if there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily . another thing they would have included is a control without a control there is nothing to compare your results to . one last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used . if you use more of one sample than another then of course it is going to way more . each sample should be the same size .
406	1	2	3	the students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in are they all solids in the same shape or are they ground up the amount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples . also they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers and that the amount of vinegar in each container should be the same . what type of vinegar it is should also be included .
407	1	0	0	a hypothesis was needed in this experiment . also the group should had told the reader what was happening why the experiment was taking place . also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate .
408	1	0	0	additional things a i would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry .
409	1	2	2	you would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted what results where they looking for . you should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions . equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
410	1	0	0	you would need . more trials . different types of samples and . maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than minutes .
411	1	0	0	the additional info i would need to replicate it is marble limestone wood plastic water container vinegar label .
412	1	2	2	the group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure . they need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container . the group also does not tell you how to way each sample s mass .
413	1	0	0	limestone you would need because it s the most important of then it won t work when you used it .
414	1	0	0	they need to repeat every step that already performed .
415	1	3	3	in order to replicate this group s procedure i would need the following information p . when they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples they should name and list the samples that they plan on using . p . in step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in . p . when they say in step four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water how much water should we use and how long should we rinse .
416	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample . you would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer .
417	1	3	3	in order to replicate the group students experiment the additional information i would need to endure how big the four identical containers were how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment . how much vinegar and the students pour into each container .
418	1	1	1	the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following what changes had each sample after sitting hours . and the one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar we pour in each four separate but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation . what did we learn
419	1	1	1	in order to replicate the group s experiment there is additional information that would need to be known such as how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample .
420	1	2	2	in order to do this experiment again you would need to know the exact mass of the samples what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for .
421	1	3	3	some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each separate containers . if i did not have the data table i would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are . it would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used . in order to replicate on experiment the procedure must be precise and not have any information out or else the data may come out completely different and not be comparable to the first set of data .
422	1	0	0	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the quantity of the variables sample materials . it is necessary to know how the samples were rinsed w distilled water use . were they put in a riff container or just held under a steam of water mostly eva pol anti i need to know how they determined the mass of the samples what was their tool of measurement .
423	1	3	3	in order to repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for hours so that the experiment does not get ruined due to the surroundings it was in .
424	1	3	3	you would need a control to look back on you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container in with and get the time right . with the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials .
425	1	0	0	what was the purpose for them doing this experiment p why did they choose to set up there label this way p and for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there s no problem also there not a lot of information provide that examples the directions .
426	1	0	0	it doesn t tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation . so we would be able to do the work but i would know what we did if for after .
427	1	1	1	if there is a control they would need to identify it they should also tell the type of material tell the mass unit of measurement .
428	1	3	3	additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers . also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . also although indicated in the data table the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in . should it be poured limestone a block of wood etc . and also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end . all of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment .
429	1	0	0	you should in all procedures out in an actually experiments .
430	1	1	1	one step that missed was to gather all all the materials . another step that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup . another step they might have to add as well is how much distilled water that would be to one each europe .
431	1	0	0	in addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples .
432	1	0	0	after reading the groups procedure i think they should have added record the data get materials observe the experiment and repeat experiment .
433	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the samples ex perhaps in the procedure are without this information i could use nothing as the samples that get completely difference show .
434	1	1	1	i would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes . also i would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that i have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples .
435	1	0	0	they should have said how much of each sample they put in each containers .
436	1	0	0	the additional information that i would need is to add another independent variable to the procedure other than vinegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar . also to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time . then we can come to the conclusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples .
437	1	1	1	after reading the group s procedure some good additional information would be what the containers are made of the dependent variable and the dependent variable .
438	1	2	1	first off i d need to know maybe the material of each sample
439	1	2	2	in this experiment an additional formation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container . this may effect the amount of mass lost for the samples . i also think placing them in certain places with different temperatures effects how much the samples would loose mass .
440	1	2	2	this group is lacking a control group in their procedure . also they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers . next the group should have car vilified what kind of samples were needed in step .
441	1	2	2	first i would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container . also i would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would be stored in over the hour period . p lastly i would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids .
442	1	2	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know how much volume or mm you would need to pour into the containers . also you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers . nothing b messed up in the experiment . and step does not explicate how to d it does the experiment want the containers to have the same area it does not explicate .
443	1	2	2	there are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it . first step says determine the nose of four different samples . they should have said what the samples were of . second step says pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar . third there is no control in this experiment . they should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control .
444	1	2	3	additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to pour into each container . it should say what each sample is in the procedures . a list of materials .
445	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how big samples to use . you would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment .
446	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment the group s procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in g to specify which samples were being used marble limestone wood of plastic . and specify the size and type of the containers used beakers
447	1	1	1	additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers should i buy the materials or use natural resources .
448	1	1	1	if i has to replicate the ex pigment i would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign . also how do you determine the mass .
449	1	3	3	this information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment p amount of vinegar poured p identify types of samples used in the procedure p temperature and p size of containers open closed lid
450	1	1	1	after reading this procedure i would advise these students to make step easier to understand . in order to replicate this experiment you would need to label what material is going into the container what you re labeling it and what single sample enters the container in the end . also to make this experiment more reliable you would need to add more trials to your procedure . also if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table you would need to identify the four samples in step one .
451	1	0	0	one thing they should do is explain why they are testing vinegar . also they should have a hypothesis .
452	1	1	1	you would need to add materials that you need to use . you also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups . you should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like a b c d .
453	1	0	0	in order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers you would need to use some sect of measuring material like a scale to know the affects of vinegar on the material you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass .
454	1	3	3	to replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment . also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers . finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is touching it .
455	1	1	1	in the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example the could say determine the mass of different rock samples . i also think they say sample too many times . you get confused about what they are saying . one last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container .
456	1	0	0	where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . why do you need vinegar where does the acid come from
457	1	0	0	after reading this group s procedure i think they should have used more than four samples so they could find out different sources from other types of stone . also i think they should have one more trials .
458	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment i would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so i don t put in too much or too little . i would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the samples and lastly if i had only looked at the group s procedure i would need to know what four samples the students used so that i could replicate the experiment . and then i would need to know where the containers were kept so i could give mine the same amount of light and other things .
459	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure i determined that in order to replicate the experiment additional information is needed . first the procedure doesn t state what is being tested we need to know what specific samples are being referred to next we haven t been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers . lastly we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container .
460	1	0	0	the additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples which is the marble limestone wood and plastic . the information that is needed is the starting and ending mass .
461	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment the groups would have to list the different mass samples if not then a person might use any different mass samples . also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample . lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers to make this procedure replicate able the group would have to make these change .
462	1	3	2	three pieces of additional information that i would need are as follows . first how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers secondly how large should the samples be the last thing i would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be .
463	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment i would also need to know in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers . otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment .
464	1	3	3	after reading the group s procedure in and for me to replicate this experiment i would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for . me knowing these three additional sources of information i could successfully replicate this experiment .
465	1	0	0	to replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers in case the water has an effect on it . also you can try doing the experiment for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results . last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them .
466	1	3	3	you would need to know what the four different samples are . also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . lastly you need to know what temperature to store them at .
467	1	3	3	the group s procedure was pretty vague there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar and how large the samples are . also each sample should be named in the procedure like determine the mass of marble limestone wood and plastic samples should be stated in the procedure .
468	1	1	1	to repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers you would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples .
469	1	3	3	just based off of the procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount . you d also need to know what in use as a container as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result . you d also need to know the starting mass of each sample and what the samples are .
470	1	0	0	well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water . three pieces of information limestone plastic marble .
471	1	1	1	after reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour . also they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc . both of these observations should be added to the produce in order to do the experiment .
472	1	2	2	some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment . first of all the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment marble limestone wood and plastic . they also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar and type of vinegar that needs to be put in each cup . the procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials .
473	1	3	3	you would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material for example plastic could
474	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample . another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers . a third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak all of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment .
475	1	1	1	information i would need p what do they want to find out in other words their implied aim . p the amount of vinegar . p the amount of sample .
476	1	2	2	to be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things . for example do they want us to use the same materials of course they do so that s one . another is what kind of containers do they want us using we can use plastic or metal or another . lastly you would need to know how much distilled water that you need .
477	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the people used . if we don t know and we use more or less it could change the experiments outcome . also we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones . and finally it would help if they measured the mass in between the hours .
478	1	1	1	one additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar in ml is needed to pour into the containers . every container needs the same amount of vinegar . the other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else you would miss the point . the third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in . they all need the same unit and balance .
479	1	2	2	to repeat this experiment i would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should be .
480	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated .
481	1	1	1	what they missed was the samples that they were pouring the vinegar on . they need to have every piece of information in the procedure . so other people can do this job .
482	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass because if we put a different amount we re going to get a different result .
483	1	2	2	one thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container . also which samples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use . for example the whole object half the object . also if they were making a table what information do u need to record .
484	1	0	0	pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers . p after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water . p placing a single sample of one material into one container and label . repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a single .
485	1	0	0	you would need starting mass ending mass and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment .
486	1	0	1	to replicate this experiment you will need the same ingredient and procedures also the time . also do a graph showing the difference in weight . we need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one .
487	1	0	0	nor
488	1	0	0	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to pouring i sample into more than just one container instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water wait hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for minutes let it dry for hour .
489	1	1	2	how to extract the materials from the vinegar . what conditions would the materials be drying . ex sunny warm place or dark cold place . what conditions would the material be soaking in temp light next
490	1	1	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups that way you would get more accurate results .
491	1	2	2	you would need to know how much vinegar to use what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment .
492	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment the following information is needed the amount of vinegar that is needed in this experiment should be given . in this experiment to much or to little corner may be used . there should as be multiple trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinegar in . and the labeling may not be the right label . the experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with .
493	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment they would need to determine what the materials were they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass .
494	1	1	1	after reading the groups procedure some information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water . also i would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup . lastly you would need to do multiple trials for reliability .
495	1	2	1	some additional information i would need would include what objects to determine the mass of . also to replicate this procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container seeing as the group doesn t give an exact amount . i would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with . finally their procedure doesn t tell exactly how to determine the mass .
496	1	2	2	the procedure should include what the four different samples are . at this point it is to vague and needs to be specified . the procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers . the procedure should also encourage repetition . human and equipment errors as always possible . therefore it should give the readers an notion for the detests if necessary . finally the procedure does not include a control . this doesn t give the readers anything to compare the results .
497	1	0	0	the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble limestone wood and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each . what material did you use to get this answer . what effects did it have on all material such as color and size .
498	1	1	1	i would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample . p what are they trying to find out through pass is to amount . p was there a control group in this experiment .
499	1	3	3	you would need to know how big of cups to use . how much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get .
500	1	3	3	some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh so they are all equal . what type of container should the sample be put into how should i determine the mass of the different samples how much vinegar to pour into the samples .
501	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use for amount of marble limestone and wood water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material .
502	1	1	1	to exactly replicate this experiment you leash need to know how much of each sample to test with . also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with .
503	1	2	2	you need something like a scale to determine the mass . determine the mass of four different samples . you need to identify what that sample . you also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed .
504	1	2	3	determine the mass of four samples of what how much vinegar is needed in the containers you would need a scale to measure the different containers . are the different containers made of the same material
505	1	3	3	you would need to know the amount of vinegar they added what kind of containers and how much or how big each object is .
506	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with . as well as how they determined the mass of the samples . lastly they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers .
507	1	2	2	there are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment . some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be . these would help because will not them you don t know which samples you are supposed to use and if they re not all the same across you could get invalid results . also they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else once again there is a risk of the data being invalid .
508	1	2	2	some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers the actually samples they use marble limestone wood plastic and how you would measure the mass of each sample .
509	1	2	1	the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers how much vinegar is put in each of the containers and how much of the sample is in each container . in the procedure they don t say what was in each of the containers . they also didn t say how much vinegar that they put into the containers . lastly they didn t say how much of the sample was in the containers . they needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment .
510	1	1	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment .
511	1	2	2	i would need to know several things before replicating this job . first i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . also i would need to know what i should do to determine the mass of the samples . lastly i would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers i should use .
512	1	0	0	i would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn t it poisoning to humans .
513	1	2	1	to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately . also the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment . also in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps and so later on the difference can be found and the change seen .
514	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment i would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in . secondly i need to know on what i should place the samples on to allow them to dry . lastly to replicate the experiment i need to know the control group and the type of container i should use . also it would be necessary to know what i should weigh the samples on .
515	1	3	3	in order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off .
516	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated . you would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical . a third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them . in the procedure the samples identities are not given .
517	1	1	1	additional information they could have added is mass the weight of vinegar poured into the samples . they also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories . more thing that could be changed is have more trials with different samples and repeat the process used . also they could have waited for more than minutes to let the distilled water dry oil out .
518	1	1	1	additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do i pour into each container also i would need to know the control of the experiment so i could see what changed and how . i also need to know what i should use to measure the mass . they only say trees the mass in their experiment they never told me specifically what to measure it with .
519	1	3	3	more information would be needed to replicate the experiment . it needs to be explained what the samples are of . it should say how much vinegar to use . also it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar . there should be a control included within the experiment . directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass .
520	1	1	0	use the same material that is used for the experiment .
521	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific . it would need to tell how much vinegar is used in the containers have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after minutes and say what the samples are weighed with . it is also important that safety precautions are told such as gloves or goggles .
522	1	1	1	i would need to know what the samples were .
523	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much of the samples to use how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be .
524	1	0	0	why they even did it is in the first place . and what am i wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would i get the supplies i needed . and if there s anything that i shouldn t use in this experiment .
525	1	0	0	the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is a watch a measuring container also some marbles limestone wood and plastic .
526	1	2	3	to repeat this experiment again you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers . the volume could each have to be equal to get the best results . next you would want to know the volume of the containers so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment you have the same results . last you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used and the volume of the samples so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar .
527	1	3	3	in order to replicate this group s experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
528	1	2	2	one extra piece of information that i would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass . i would also need to know what the four different samples were . in addition i would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used .
529	1	3	2	the additional information that should be included in this procedure is . how much vinegar goes in each sample . where do the samples go to sit and dry at . label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data .
530	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the group s hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect . this will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar . lastly i would need to see results from a controlled experiment such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay .
531	1	2	2	there are several pieces of information that i would need to replicate this experiment . firstly in step one i would want to know specifically what the four different samples were . secondly in step two i need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . thirdly in step three i would need to know how much of each material to put into each container . having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent . all three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating .
532	1	2	2	the three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows
533	1	0	0	i would have to check the mass of four different samples . put vinegar in each one of the separate containers . put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone wood and plastic . while waiting hours . i would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour .
534	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . you would also need to know what the materials are that you re putting into containers . you also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are . all these things are essential to replicating this experiment .
535	1	2	2	information i would need to replicate i mass samples . should i
536	1	1	1	same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container . i would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn t talk about acid rain once .
537	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know p . how much vinegar to put in each container p . how much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water temperature of water as well p . what temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying . p . how big the containers are p . what environment is the experiment taking place in hot warm freezing wet etc .
538	1	0	0	after reading the group s procedure the group should add a hypothesis control and objective .
539	1	2	2	after reading the procedure to their experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar to use what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with and what are the fair samples suppose to be
540	1	2	2	the procedure should contain what different samples are going to weighed . it also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers . lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table .
541	1	2	1	the procedure is very flowed because i can t even understand half of it when they are talking about the four samples . they need to clarify what the samples are . they also need to clearly give the distinction of the container the samples and where vinegar is poured into . lastly they need to not write step because the container sample and label have no refereed and are just plain rent stir .
542	1	3	3	any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that s mass are being determined where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water .
543	1	1	1	a couple more things i would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis . also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly . lastly i would also i would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the beginning and the end .
544	1	2	3	they didn t mention how much vinegar to put in the containers . this could effect the mass of the object at the end . they should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are .
545	1	0	0	pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers . after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water . allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes .
546	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock s masses how much vinegar you re putting the rocks in . finally you need to know how much of each sample you re putting in a container .
547	1	2	2	first you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup . second you will need to know the temperature of the room . third you will also need to know whether the scale used was electric or normal .
548	1	2	2	additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would include what the sample materials i was using were what kind of result am i looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that i am suppose to attempt to solve . it would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed whether it be in the sun or in the dark . by knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible .
549	1	0	0	one thing they could have that they don t is a control of this procedure . the next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material . the final thing is that i think with starting and ending mass they should have multiple tells .
550	1	1	1	i would like to know what the experiment is for what are the measurements for all this how much vinegar in each container
551	1	2	2	to make this experiment s procedure complete three additional things are needed . first the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification . second the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers . finally all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier . these additional steps would make the procedure better .
552	1	3	3	additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to put in each container . do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials also other info would be what size containers do you need for this experiment . lastly does it matter the material of the container glass metal . throw away containers .
553	1	0	0	to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the students goal was . i always label how much of an amount to put into a container . in their procedure its that the students did not do this .
554	1	0	1	i would needed to know what different samples to find the mass how much starting mass i would need and how to measure the ending mass . without these three pieces of information i would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly .
555	1	3	2	i would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dried in a different way . would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry . also i would need to know where i should place a sample . lastly i would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white apple material . also i would need to know how top measure the mass .
556	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container . you will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample and what the samples actually are of what material .
557	1	0	1	the students need a list of material also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis . the students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment .
558	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh . you would also need to know what four samples to use . also to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container .
559	1	3	3	in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need some additional information . i would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container .
560	1	1	1	the additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn t say which samples to use in the procedure . you would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass . you would also need the samples to dry for more than minutes to get better results because the original results didn t have a large difference in mass .
561	1	1	1	in step one they could tell you the different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container . after step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed .
562	1	1	1	there is something missing . in the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers . what it fails to mention is how much vinegar to pour into each container . without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinegar added but there is no mention of how much to add
563	1	2	2	i would need to know what to measure the weight in how much vinegar to put in and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for .
564	1	1	1	while i would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors . how to get the starters mass of each sample . between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it .
565	1	3	3	if you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel and tell the size of each of the samples .
566	1	2	2	we would need to know the four types of sample mentioned in would need to be classified . temperature of vinegar type of wood plastic etc they used and the amount of vinegar they poured into each container .
567	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use . one would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container . also the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this .
568	1	2	2	step one really should go at the end . you need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers . tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested . tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it . i would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph .
569	1	1	0	in order to adequately replicate this experiment one would need more specific samples for example instead of wood it should be a specific type of wood marble limestone or plastic . the procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after hours .
570	1	1	1	you would need the independent variable that never changes . to replicate the experiment would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers . also how did the mass reacted to the substance .
571	1	1	1	one thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar . and lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for days weeks it never tells you this information it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things .
572	1	0	0	first off you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain . also to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again . the person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other hours . more water and vinegar would be needed too .
573	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment the students need to include more detail in their procedure . first we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment . the students tell us to pour vinegar into containers however it is not clear how much vinegar to use if the amounts of vinegar are different the entire experiment will not be accurate . to improve the experiment the students could have done more trials to get better observations .
574	1	0	0	i would need to know how
575	1	1	1	one thing they should include is how much vinegar they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers .
576	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment i need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers i need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other .
577	1	3	2	additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is to whether i should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the hour time period . also i would need to know if i should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area . i would also need to know how much vinegar should use it doesn t state it clearly .
578	1	3	3	you would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain . you would also need to know what type of materials you need . another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more . you would also need to know where the containers were placed for the hours whether they were placed at cool temperature hot or cold .
579	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container . you need to know the different samples what to do with the difference in masses what do the difference in the mass s tell you
580	1	0	0	this procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams . they gave four different samples but they didn t include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples . the purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples .
581	1	1	1	first off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers also that they should have added control or just water to have samples to confound and do .
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material . and the third thing is they need a controlled .
583	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups .
584	1	1	1	you would need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples . also place the same amount of vinegar and water into each container allowing students to record the correct data .
585	1	2	2	the additional information i need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container what kind of container am i supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object .
586	1	0	0	if i replicated this i would also need what i uses acid rain in measuring the container masses and how the acid rain would effect
587	1	3	2	in order to replicate this group s experiment i would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container . also i would need to know what type of marble limestone wood and plastic was used . finally i would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment .
588	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use what it should be able to hold how much vinegar to pour into each container how many ml what type of vinegar what to weigh the samples on bathroom scale or type of beam balance maybe electronic .
589	1	2	2	the procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first it should include measurements . we need to know how much vinegar to put with each sample second the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals .
590	1	1	0	to replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions record your data .
591	1	2	2	in order to replicate this procedure they should include a set mass for each stone i . e g of each sample . they also should include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container .
592	1	2	2	i would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn t say in the procedure . i would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . i would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water .
593	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment i would need other than the procedure what samples to use what materials how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in . these pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results . using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain . finally the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during hours .
594	1	2	2	the group needs to include each specific in their conclusion . the amount of vinegar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container . the group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample . the table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure .
595	1	1	1	you may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in explain how you found the differences in mass mass before you rinse with the distilled water .
596	1	2	2	in the procedure the group should have included what samples they were going to use marble limestone wood plastic the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup . it would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately .
597	1	2	2	the students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items . they would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container . it is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water .
598	1	0	0	you wouldn t need any information . they provide you with all the information you need . they tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart .
599	1	2	2	additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in . this doesn t tell you if each sample was covered by vinegar completely or if it was partially covered . the starting mass of limestone was . g the ending mass was . g that was a . g difference . the experiment doesn t tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar . this is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment .
600	1	1	1	what are the four samples are what kind of materials you would need are going out a hypothesis .
601	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment i would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass how much vinegar do i pour in each of the four samples and am i doing all four at the same time . so they are taking out in hours at the same time .
602	1	2	2	in order for me to replicate this groups experiment i need to know what type of sample am i weighing . i need to know how much vinegar am i pouring in the containers . i also need to know what i am labeling on containers and what was i use to remove samples from the containers .
603	1	3	3	some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these things would make very experiment as close as possible to the group s .
604	1	2	2	you would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment . one would be how much vinegar to pour into the container . another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ . a third piece of information needed would be what samples to use . also if they should all start out with the same mass or not .
605	1	2	2	the additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container . i also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container . where do you let the samples sit for hours inside outside by a window
606	1	2	2	one piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container . another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples . also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing .
607	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal . i would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the hours ex shade sun . lastly i would need to know what kind of container should be used a plastic a covered or a dark container etc .
608	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know what the sample was a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution vinegar that should be applied for each sample having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity
609	1	1	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the different materials are that i d be testing . in addition i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample . finally i would need to know that i was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples . otherwise i would be missing my dependent variable
610	1	0	0	to replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for hours for about minutes mass them and see how they wash .
611	1	2	2	you need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change little .
612	1	2	2	. have a determined size for the starting samples of rock . p . determine an amount of vinegar . p . determine what type of containers are being used .
613	1	0	0	you will need to know which rock had the most mass which one had the least and which one was the same .
614	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers how much water you rinse the containers with where it is being dried and how to measure the mass grams wounds etc .
615	1	2	2	i would include the materials used or the samples . also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing making and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup .
616	1	3	3	additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in how big the container should be and if the material should be or shouldn t be fully submerged by the vinegar .
617	1	2	2	one piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment . you also need to know what you re supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem . it doesn t say in the procedure to analyze the data or anything like that .
618	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample . i would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so i could compare results of the samples . lastly i would need to know if the experiment was completed .
619	1	1	1	include the name of the samples in the procedure . p say how do students measure the mass . p ask students to object ate the data and drawn conclusion .
620	1	1	1	the procedure never states what the samples are . it needs to add the four samples marbles limestone wood and plastic into the first step . the procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i being measured and in the th step that the ending mass is being measured . the procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
621	1	0	0	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the students are looking for why each steps of the procedure is being done why those four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repetitions in order to create more accurate data .
622	1	0	0	the additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be .
623	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment . first they didn t state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor . second in order to make sure their experiment was valid they could have done another trial and lastly they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results .
624	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples . the second thing you need to know is what temperature the room is when you start the experiment . the last step is write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record .
625	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment the group would need some additional information in their procedure . an example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance . they need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container or how big the sample is or what the sample is . it s very vague so they should add more specific .
626	1	0	0	i would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was i trying to find in order to replicate the experiment .
627	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all cups . this would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome . also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples . say what sample to use in the experiment too .
628	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers . even though the samples are listed in the chart the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure .
629	1	2	2	the group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container what to label the containers or what materials to put in the containers . they also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the small .
630	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure i think that in order to replicate these experiment i will need to know what type of container and about how much vinegar to put into the containers .
631	1	2	2	the additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containers and say exactly what four samples you are using . you need to have these thing sin an experiment because if you don t then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change . you also need a control group .
632	1	3	3	to tell me what the samples are in the procedure . p how much vinegar to pour in the four containers . p where and at what temperature are they putting them in .
633	1	2	2	the biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalid . another problem is that they didn t mention how much vinegar should be used . the group wasn t very specific for example they didn t say what temp . the samples should be kept at . by not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid .
634	1	0	0	after you remove the containers you rinse them see what results you get in about so minutes .
635	1	1	1	you would need to know the conditions of the sample p you would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics . p you would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types . p you would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar .
636	1	1	1	to be able to replicate the experiment you would need to know the samples you are experimenting with . although the samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure it doesn t show the samples in the procedure and if i was to do the experiment without the other groups data there is no way i could without knowing the samples .
637	1	0	0	i would need vinegar containers labels time hours a sink minutes for them to dry and a triple beam balance scale .
638	1	3	3	a person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under . all of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know .
639	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample . also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a ref regal tar or leave them at room temperature .
640	1	2	2	after reading the groups i would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment . i would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects also what kind of container to use .
641	1	0	0	i would need to know what was happening to the samples during that hours . i would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did . . i would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself .
642	1	1	1	one idea they might need to use is to say what four materials say stones are being used in your procedure . also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment missing . the group should also used more than one trial to their experiment lab .
643	1	3	3	you would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container so the results are accurate . you would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at .
644	1	1	1	in my experiment i would include steps p . gathering materials . p . observation of the substances . p . making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water .
645	1	2	1	to repeat this experiment i would need to knew how vinegar what is the control and what are the samples .
646	1	2	2	the group will need
647	1	3	3	if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure p . how big should the rock samples be p should they be relatively the same size p . how much vinegar should be poured into the containers p . how long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water p . should the containers be made out of any specific material

650	1	0	0	to replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain .
651	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using how much vinegar you should put in each container and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples .
652	1	2	2	the person doing the experiment would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the container what type of container they used . plastic metal glass etc whether or not the person would need gloves tongs and other utensils . you will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after .
653	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup . different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the experiment compromising the results .
654	1	2	2	additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured the ph level of th vinegar and much of the sample was added into the vinegar .
655	1	2	3	to replicate the experiment i would need the materials to replicate the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers . to replicate the experiment would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
656	1	3	3	i would need to know what the samples were of how much vinegar what containers what material how much of that material .

658	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples . i would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poured into each of the containers . and what temperature are the samples kept at for contain amount of time and how long for each time period .
659	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container . also you would need to how to determine mass . not to mention you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry .
660	1	0	0	after reading the group s procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about .
661	1	1	1	they could have told us the amount of vinegar used what they used to make the distilled water and the could have explained how to rinse the material . i we should look it in the water for a few seconds or just rinse them .
662	1	2	2	the group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vital information so the data qua native data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only one type of qua active data is recorded the sample type leg in a get the container and angry types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible .
663	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment i would need to know the deadly of vinegar used with each materials . i would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expense because there are many different
664	1	2	2	these other pieces of information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do i obtain marble limestone wood and plastic . since there as the of materials
665	1	1	2	in order to replicate the group s experiment you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given . one of these pieces of information is how the group determined the case of the samples . was it with a triple balance scale etc . another piece of information explained is how long each sample was . finally in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used .
666	1	1	1	additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample .
667	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of containers to use how much vinegar and
668	1	0	0	one would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them . try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence .
669	1	0	0	my first piece of information would be a bar graph then i would give specific directions on what i did . but i would make it clear so other people can easily do it to . then i would write a conclusion why this rally happened .
670	1	0	0	i would write what
671	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need . first you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample . secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need . finally you need to know the mass of the cups so you don t mix up the sample weight . that s the information you need to replicate this experiment .
672	1	2	2	it should say how much vinegar they use in each container it should say in the procedure what the samples are that they are using . each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each .
673	1	2	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials . in step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used . step six should be changed to after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass .
674	1	2	2	you would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample . different amounts of vinegar would give different results . you d also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used .
675	1	1	1	i would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass i would need to know what sample materials i m using in the procedure and i would need to know how many trials i would need to do .
676	1	0	0	you will need a solution results and a conclusion .
677	1	3	3	from this experiment i would need to know how big each of the containers are i would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container if i was to replicate this experiment . i would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers .
678	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar to poor . i would have to know what and of samples to use .
679	1	0	0	the additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label . repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container . after hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry . the additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference .
680	1	0	0	you would need to add the type of solution the stones on going in .
681	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment the group s procedure should include more specific information . they should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples . they should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labeled . this will make the procedure easier to follow . it would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers .
682	1	0	0	one additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment . also between steps and there needs to be a step to put the samples in the separate but identical containers .
683	1	2	2	how much vinegar is needed in each dish . what is the sample material . and how do you determine the mass .
684	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need the size the four containers are what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is . and how much vinegar the students poured into each container .
685	1	2	2	after reading the group experiment i believe that they will need multiple trials they also need a control . what type of container how much vinegar . also what you would use to find the mass .
686	1	2	2	to replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the re picture to keep the containers at and you need to know how much vinegar .
687	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure . i would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that i can make sure some of them gets the same amount . also i would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples by using a balance or scale etc . finally i would need to know if the containers were closed or not because that environmental factor could change the results of an my their experiment .
688	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used . second they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each material into the vinegar . lastly to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material . so the all came out equal . you would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be enables altering the result of the experiment .
689	1	3	3	to replicate this i would need much more information as to sizes of samples . also there should be more specific size measurements of the containers . lastly they never say how much vinegar to use . p all of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment .
690	1	0	0	according to the data that the students recorded the starting mass had higher levels the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience i would never background hypothesis graft conclusion problem materials i think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment .
691	1	1	2	the three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments .
692	1	3	3	the procedure is unclear . in order to effectively replicate this experiment . i would need to know what the four samples that are needed were i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . it would help to know how large each container was as well . p . vinegar amount . . types of sampling . . containers size .
693	1	2	2	the first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers . how much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present excision
694	1	2	0	you have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure . some additionally needed information would be in step what measurement are you having the mass in g kg . in step you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers . for example ml . another thing is in step what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify . lastly in step you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in .
695	1	0	1	after reading the groups procedure additional information is would need in order to replicate the experience is choose different samples to work with . instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form . and finally instead of letting the samples sit and dry for min you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than min .
696	1	1	2	after reading the group s procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is how i can determine the mass . the materials i am working with . how identical the containers have to be .
697	1	2	2	to be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vinegar to put in each containers what type of scale to use to determine the mass . also the type of container needed .
698	1	1	0	to repeat this experiment you would need a list of materials .
699	1	1	1	in step of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers .
700	1	3	3	some additional information i would need is i would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers . i would also need to know what the samples are . to replicate the experiment i would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else .
701	1	3	3	to replicate this i need to know what samples i m working with . it doesn t tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups . if says after hours remove samples from the containers where do they go for hours
702	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment it is ne sherry to know what material will be used no samples . to the different samples were listed in the procedure it would be better understand . it would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar s effect on the mass of the samples . it would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container .
703	1	1	1	the additional information i would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples . it is well specified . also i need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers then after the experiment is complete i would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples .
704	1	3	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container . the four different samples mass of them and where they were put is stated . but not how much vinegar was put into the containers .
705	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case . the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic . you would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you re testing .
706	1	3	3	i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use . also they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion .
707	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know many details . first i would need to know what samples i am using in order to find their mass . i also would need to know how large each material is . this way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how large the material was . also i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material receives the same amount . last i would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all receive the same amount of water .
708	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment the group s procedure would need to include what each of the different samples were determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state the conditions the sample would be in for example the temp . of the room .
709	1	1	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample .
710	1	3	3	you would need to know the amount of vinegar needed the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water .
711	1	0	0	the additional information you would needs was one was the best marble limestone wood and plastic .
712	1	3	3	at the start of the procedure we would need to know what four samples we were testing . otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment . we also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers . we finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in plastic glass we need to know this as well .
713	1	3	3	additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure . also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given .
714	1	0	0	this experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment . they should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass .
715	1	2	2	three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is . to know how much vinegar to use . what is the control if any and . do you cover the samples over the hr period or do you just leave them uncovered
716	1	1	1	if this experiment was going to be repeated a control would need to be used . instead of using vinegar the materials would be placed in water . also the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material . the amounts should be equal to balance it out . changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment .
717	1	1	1	some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in . they need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis .
718	1	2	1	to make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it i would need to the near of the different samples in seat . are what are its materials containers can t in step . and finally i would need to know what to measure the samples with what kind of units .
719	1	1	1	i would write down how much vinegar they put in these different example of mass . they didn t keep track of the experiment . p they also didn t repeated the experiment again and i think that one of the most important thing that everybody should do .
720	1	1	1	i think they should also put why are they doing it i mean what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature volume how to the samples in a determined place etc .
721	1	1	1	addition information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed in step you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid .
722	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in also at kind of container the label s title and the device used to measure the mass .
723	1	0	0	how much do you pour in the containers .
724	1	0	0	they also should watch how all the samples change and take notes . see if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they . then see how it changes during the day .
725	1	0	0	in order to replicate the experiment you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container . you should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar . lastly you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out .
726	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more how much of each sample material needed and how much vinegar you should pour into each container . by having this information the lab will be more accurate and correct .
727	1	1	1	the additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar which may have represented acid rain with a p . h of . was put into each sample since p there were different masses of the given samples leg . marble . g whereas wood . g . p the ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled . p the mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
728	1	3	3	after reading this procedure i have noticed that i would need to know the ph of the vinegar . also i would need to know how much vinegar is needed . lastly it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off on the samples making the results different .
729	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment they should say what temperature to keep the room at they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results . and also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in because if one sample is bigger than another that will also change the results .
730	1	2	2	in order to replicate the group s experiment i would need to know the samples being used how much vinegar to use and also what to label . without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn t include all the information needed .
731	1	2	2	the students should state what the four different samples are state how much vinegar should be used in each samples container . also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinegar in their eye .
732	1	2	2	three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are how much vinegar is needed to be poured how long do you rinse the containers for . what do you measure the mass in
733	1	2	2	in order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are . you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers so there is an even amount in each container . another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass .
734	1	2	2	i would need to know what kind of samples to use how much vinegar to put on the samples and how to label the containers to replicate the experiment .
735	1	0	0	in order needs say the information .
736	1	1	0	pour the same amount of vinegar on all four . after you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it .
737	1	1	1	after reading the group s procedure in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be . that is the only thing they would need to do .
738	1	1	1	the students didnt start with saying what materials ar needed . they also didnt say what the four samples were . the students did specify on what kind of materials they were using
739	1	1	0	as you can see the students investigation went well . the materials they used were marble limestone wood and plastic . by look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is marble limestone wood plastic . then the end mass read marble limestone wood and plastic . as you can see all of them escape limestone decreased . as you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together . so i believe as i have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results .
740	1	3	3	after reading the group s procedure i have determined they could add what four different samples you are using during the experiment . the group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers . the temperature at which the samples are to dry for min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined .
741	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment .
742	1	0	0	for the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information which is starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass . the items are marble limestone wood and plastic . then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment .
743	1	0	0	i will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and . hours i remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after i determine the mass of each sample .
744	1	3	3	additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers the size of the containers themselves and how long i would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vinegar .
745	1	2	3	they should add how much vinegar to pour into the container and how large the container must be as well . another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether or or something else to find mass you would also need to find volume .
746	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment i will need to say that list what will be the material going inside the container . p i will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples . identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials .
747	1	3	3	you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not .
748	1	2	2	the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container . and also the site of the container needed for this experiment .
749	1	2	2	they should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container . they should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container . they need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for hours . also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for minutes .
750	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know a saw things . i would need to know how much vinegar they used what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used .
751	1	2	1	how much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples . they should have said how much water to rinse each sample with also could you try different liquids .
752	1	0	0	take an hypothesis of what masses they ll have analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem .
753	1	2	2	the additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar placed in each cup i would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself . i would need to know how big each undivided
754	1	2	3	the students left out some important information in the procedure like how much vinegar should be put into the cups . if we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment . where should the samples dry warm cold in the sun
755	1	0	0	packet in fat it don t make no sense .
756	1	2	2	to replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers . you would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use .
757	1	1	1	some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but sticking with
758	1	3	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need a hypothesis the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid i would need . i would do the experiment the same way so i would also need to know what kind of container to use . i would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended .
759	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included . in step the size of the container must be included . for step the units being used used to be stated .
760	1	1	1	the additional info that you need is a control how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used .
761	1	1	1	the first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar . they didn t go into enough detail on what their experiment is about .
762	1	2	3	i would need to know how much of each material will be needed . also i will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical . lastly i must know where the containers were placed in the sun shade etc . or my results may vary .
763	1	2	2	additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment . p vinegar affects the mass of sample when it go inside absorb . p temperature affects evaporation . p efficiency when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions .
764	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers . that would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks and not the amount of vinegar . also i may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list .
765	1	0	0	the additional information i would add would be to record the data at the end of the procedure . find the average of the samples . to find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container .
766	1	1	1	i will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else . they could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples .
767	1	1	1	number one you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers .
768	1	1	1	in the procedure the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers . however the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added . by not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students amount . also there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found .
769	1	2	2	you would need to know how much wood limestone marble and plastic you would need . also how much vinegar to put in the container . how long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water those are the information that you would need to do this experiment .
770	1	2	2	the group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container . in their procedure they also should have
771	1	2	2	if you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know p what the samples are so you could use them p how much vinegar to put into the containers . p what materials you need to gather without the above information you couldn t properly replicate the experiment .
772	1	0	0	the procedure could be better if they included in there experiment a control if they labeled each sample specifically with what process they are using whether it be marble limestone wood or plastic . last the procedure doesn t include a clear purpose why are they doing this experiment is it hesse cary what variety do they receive from this .
773	1	2	2	to replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting . the students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested . the final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organized with no missing steps or information .
774	1	0	0	the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again do everything you did already but start with the information you already have then determine the mass you end up with and the difference in the mass . that s how i would replicate the experiment .
775	1	0	0	to replicate the experiment you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid . they should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include . lastly that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass .
776	1	0	0	additional information that should ve been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples because something could ve went wrong during at least one of the trials . bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass .
777	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment the group s procedure should mention which samples to use . marble limestone wood and plastic . it should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container and the size of the samples needed for testing .
778	1	1	1	after you would rinse each sample it would be best to check the reporter how much vinegar where used and i would like to know specially how many acid you use in this experiment .
779	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know p which kind of samples to use . p how much vinegar to add to each sample . p how much of each sample to use .
780	1	0	0	limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood marble and plastic so this investigation is complete .
781	1	2	2	there are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment . first of all the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are so their names would have to be included in the first step . additionally the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container . in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers . finally the last step states to determine the mass of each sample but does not give a unit of measurement . therefore it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams . with this additional information one could now replicate the experiment .
782	1	2	2	to replicate the group s experiment more information is necessary . the students should have included the material types instead of four different samples and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample container size .
783	1	0	0	on the groups procedure some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in hours and how do you find the difference in mass .
784	1	1	1	they should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idea was affected .
785	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know which samples to use . then i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container which is very important . finally i would need to know what to label each container . in order to reciprocate this experiment exactly . adding on i would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately .
786	1	2	3	one piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container . what the four samples are .
787	1	2	2	some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar . they should also say what the sample is .
788	1	3	3	how much vinegar they added into each container and how long do you rise each sample for also the temperature the writer would be where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold hot areas .
789	1	2	2	some additional information that would be needed is for number how much vinegar is needed the size that the containers should be and also another piece of information needed is when and what information should be recorded .
790	1	2	2	information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used .
791	1	0	0	. you will need on hypothesis . p . you will need a independent variable . p . you will need a dependant variable .
792	1	0	0	after reading their procedure i don t even know what they are trying to do . if it was my procedure i would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on . i would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well .
793	1	2	2	in order to a successful introductions of the experiment we would need to know what the different samples are . how much vinegar should be pour into the containers . and what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample .
794	1	1	1	after reading this group procedure some information that i would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers . without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid . there would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass .
795	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what materials i needed what kind of sample and how much of it .
796	1	1	0	i need the tiger the area and the weight to know the mass .
797	1	2	3	although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure . in addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well . most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie g . the results are skewed when wood which is grams is compared to grams of plastic . the procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples .
798	1	1	1	some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is to say how many containers and what size how many containers and what size how much of the sample to put in the container .
799	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment additional information is needed . first the amount of vinegar would be needed . also the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities . finally the temperatures of the room where the solutions sat needs to be known .
800	1	0	0	you would need to give information on what the experiment is about .
801	1	0	0	the first thing thing they did wrong was they didn t explain what their objective and investigation was about . also they didn t compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass . they got information but it did not have any mention to it .
802	1	0	0	this is a clear investigation of the acid rain they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the difference in mass .
803	1	1	1	the procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the samples in which would he grams as shown in the data table . also what to measure them with . it should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers . and finally the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples in step
804	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment additional information is needed . you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container in step you need to know what material you are putting in each container . you also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in step .
805	1	3	2	after reading the group s procedure i can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment . first i would need to the materials needed for the lab . i would need to get these items in ahead of time and have the right things like containers . i would also need to know what kind of rocks were used . if i was looking at a sheet or instructions that contained only the procedure i would need to know what rocks were used . a third thing the procedure hasn t told us is the amount of vinegar . for this to be a valid experiment we would need to use the same amount of vinegar .
806	1	0	1	they would need to state the four different samples that they are using . they also could have done different trials of the experiment and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got .
807	1	3	3	after reading the group procedure the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples . the group does not say what they are also one over not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container . the group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample .
808	1	0	0	additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get cups weigh the cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar .
809	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment additional formation is needed . the samples p need to be listed . also why those samples were chosen needs to be p added in order to replicate the experiment . another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass .

829	1	1	1	the additional information i would need is how many trials they re going to do . also how much vinegar they have to or in each container . another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need goggles gloves etc .
830	1	1	1	some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples . also since there is multiple varieties of plastic . they could state what kind of plastic they used .
831	1	0	0	you would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed .
832	1	2	2	the procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar i ll be pouring into the containers also what kind of container i ll be using . when determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks .

845	1	3	3	after reading the group s procedure additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry tint paper towel in the sun . etc
846	1	1	1	i believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn t pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed .
847	1	3	3	some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container the size or amount of each sample needed the type of containers to hold each sample in .
848	1	0	0	in this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all samples and the ending mass of all of them . you may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for hours . what would that do to the samples .
849	1	1	1	to replicate this you would a hypothesis . also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample . you would not be able to detest this experiment this information . one other thing you might need is a control for the experiment something to compare the results with .
850	1	2	2	i would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if i have to use marble limestone wood and plastic and how much vinegar to use i would also need to know is how big the container is .

852	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample . also i would need to know how to mass the samples determine the mass is too vague sets no . finally i would need to know what type of containers to use plastic cups styrofoam covers p initial amount for each samples .
853	1	0	0	the first starting mass was for wood . g ending mass . g and difference in mass . g . second was limestone with starting mass . g ending mass . g difference . g . third starting mass was marble . g ending mass at . g and difference in mass . g . last was plastic starting mass . g ending mass . g difference . g .
854	1	0	0	the group would need to table the date explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the outcome of their experiment was . this will help the pa nature to make and since as to what you are trying to find out and day .
855	1	2	2	some additional information how much vinegar do i pour into the cup . who sample materials are they using . how do i find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be added .
856	1	0	0	i would need the procedure the samples starting mass ending mass and difference in mass .
857	1	2	2	additional information i would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container . i would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment .
858	1	1	1	after reading the group s procedure some additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be p to know the amount of vinegar they used p to know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since they didn t label that p to know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container because that will effect the results and decrease validity .
859	1	2	3	some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers what kinda of containers or size of container . was each sample poured in to . and finally why did the group of students and with distilled water . why couldn t they just leave it how it was .
860	1	3	3	one piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers . a second piece is to know samples of what the first step says samples but can they be anything lastly i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment . i should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that .
861	1	2	2	after reading the group s procedure i think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers . also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time and what kind of containers did they use beaker test tube a regular container
862	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the samples two how big the pieces of rocks are if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers do they need a lid to cover evaporation how large are they . more specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here .
863	1	0	0	. place marble limestone wood and plastic into separate containers . p . let them sit for hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water . p . allow the samples to dry for minutes .
864	1	2	2	the additional information i would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the hours and a problem statement said also be necessary .
865	1	2	2	in this experiment the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure . when it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers it doesn t tell me how much i should fill in them . step is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container it doesn t explain the sample . also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples .
866	1	2	2	first you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent . next you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster . also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds .
867	1	1	1	when simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistent measurements to the data and results are accurate . they should start with the same amount of mass a each sample . so the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally . by the same wage it is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar . b c the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible .
868	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed . the size of the container needs to be determined . also the procedure just says four different samples it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers . finally it doesn t say how long the sample should be rinse for . if those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated .
869	1	1	1	there is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot . you need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup . if you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct . you should have the vinegar at a constant measurement .
870	1	2	2	first you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container . second you need a control for comparison purposes . third you need to state the size of the containers .
871	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to why they are performing this experiment and what it is trying to prove . you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant . lastly it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren t different because that could vary your results .
872	1	1	0	the additional information that i would need to know how many of each individual sample i am finding the mass for p they didn t say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample .
873	1	2	2	additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m s of vinegar would i pour into the four containers . also i would need to know what material to put in each container . i would also need to know the measurement .
874	1	3	3	in the students procedure you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity . also they should specify what type of container to put each sample in such as a test tube or a beaker . the students should specify what samples to use in step as well so that when replicated the same samples will be used .
875	1	1	0	in order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure . the group needs to include the problem a hypothesis of what they re testing materials they need to perform the experiment and a conclusion that analyses their data and states whether their hypothesis was wrong or right . the group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed .
876	1	1	1	how much vinegar you will need to put in the container what is the control variable what s the dependent and independent variable .
877	1	0	0	what you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for hours and not any other time . how you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for min .
878	1	0	0	in the experiment they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone the one that went down the most . if the experiment was for an hour it would double .
879	1	1	1	how much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment . p how much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment . p what should i use to determine the mass in my experiment .
880	1	1	1	to successfully replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials . i would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar . the final piece of information i would need to know is how much distilled water i am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples .
881	1	0	0	to make a hypothesis . p after to make a conclusion . p determine if the investigation is good or bad .
882	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment i need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the beginning and the volume at the end of the experiment .
883	1	2	2	i would need to know what the four different samples of material i was massing were . i would need to know how much vinegar to add . i would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found . in the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment goggles hat
884	1	2	2	they need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container . they need to tell like where they will place the containers if it has to be in warm place or room temperature . they have actually determine the mass .
885	1	2	2	to be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did i would need the amount of vinegar in each asp . i would also need to know the environment around the samples for example the temperature they were left to sit in . lastly i would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure .
886	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of sample material is needed how much vinegar to put in each container and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results .
887	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure i would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment . for example i would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample . then how much vinegar should be added to each container . finally i would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment .
888	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment i would need is know what type of sample i would need to measure the mass . additionally i would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in . also i would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment .
889	1	0	1	you would need to know first the materials needed for the experiment . then if the materials are listed it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure . second you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance . also you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container . would it be necessary to take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples .
890	1	2	2	what kind of containers big small what are the samples they don t tell us what they are they could be anything you don t know there rocks until you look at the data table . in this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label . what sample what material what containers and what are we supposed to label the sample or what is being put into
891	1	1	1	in order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions .
892	1	3	3	to replicate this experiment you would need the following information . you would need the amount of vinegar the students used you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used . also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used .
893	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the ph of the vinegar and the room temperature
894	1	3	3	a the group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample . p b the size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment . p c would need to know what materials to gather .
895	1	2	2	i would need to know what are the samples like the ones they put in their table at other ones . they don t state what the samples have to be . they also don t say how much should the samples weigh . they also don t say how much vinegar should be used . should it be the same amount or no because they all weigh different amounts .
896	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure i would need to know the most important part of the experiment the samples i would use . in the procedure the group does not say that you need marble limestone wood and plastic . additional information i would need would be how much of each sample i would need because i may need a band or couple of ances and i would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample .
897	1	0	0	this table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables . it s still missing the control group . the indecent variable is the change in mass . the purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples .
898	1	2	2	the three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project . and also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after hours process .
899	1	0	0	well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples they vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water .
900	1	0	0	the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples make sure you let it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers .
901	1	1	2	i would need to know how much vinegar was used . i would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for hours . lastly i would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used .
902	1	1	1	additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started . a final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate . one important thing they need to mention in this procedure is what four different materials we are using .
903	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples . otherwise the data can be affected without this constant . also it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble limestone wood and plastic are the specific materials used . this needs to be included in the procedure . finally the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don t affect the validity of the experiment .
904	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know first or all what each sample is . they would also need to know how much vinegar to use on the materials . lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material . the would need and the substance size .
905	1	2	2	additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be what the sample are how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly how do i determine the mass of each sample in other words what type of measuring device do i use .
906	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment first off i have to know which sample is which . when recording the mass i will not know which belongings to the correct sample . also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with so this needs to be clearer . last of all in order to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers because different amounts of vinegar can change the results . last of all in step it tell us to remove the samples but i do not know ways to remove those samples in a separate cup or container
907	1	3	3	so additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
908	1	0	0	you would need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass .
909	1	2	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . you would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers . in addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else .
910	1	1	1	additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container . if you do too much it s or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried . also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data . including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn t without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down .
911	1	0	0	what is the independent variable and what the dependent variable also don t p forget about the control .
912	1	0	0	in order for or to replicate the experiment the chart needs to show every piece of the experiment like what happened when you put vinegar on four separate piles but identical containers on how you put one piece of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one piece of material in one container for all of it each . by showing all the data then you ll be able to replicate the experiment .
913	1	2	2	one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step to pour into the containers . another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step . a last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for in step .
914	1	1	1	. you need to know the amount of vinegar being added . p . you need a control group . p . you need to know what your labeling each container .
915	1	1	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to find the mass of the samples possibly using an electronic balance . i would also need to know how big of a container to use . sometimes if you have a lot of vinegar the results will be different . i would also need to know the purpose of the lab . is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the samples
916	1	0	0	i would need to determine the mass of four different samples . also place a sample of one material into one container and label and after hours remove the samples from the containers . i would have to do the mass of grams for the samples .
917	1	0	0	make sure to include at least three pieces of information . samples have lost in for nation because get information . sample allow the samples to fit and dry for minutes . p because determine the mass of each sample .
918	1	1	1	first would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure the students do not provide a clear explanation of what is being tested . also how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not . the acids on our fingers could affect the samples they should also describe how to figure out the mass the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass .
919	1	1	1	to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use such as marble or plastic . you would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end . between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample .
920	1	2	2	the additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample .
921	1	0	0	i think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment .
922	1	3	3	some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need the size of the containers used in the experiment . you would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the hour period .
923	1	2	2	some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar i would need to put in each container . the last thing i would need to know is if i can use more than four samples .
924	1	2	3	to replicate the groups procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container . you would also need a control which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in .
925	1	1	1	in this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it . the students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good however it does not state what the purpose is here . i think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples . you would also need to know what samples you could use .
926	1	3	3	after reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the .
927	1	3	3	in order to replicate the acid rain experiment we must know more than what the group has given us . for example in step the students don t tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container . they also don t tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of . in step the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples . they don t say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples . another problem is that they don t tell us what the samples are until we see the data table they should say it in the procedure .
928	1	3	2	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used . also you would need to know what size and shape the samples are . also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn t state .
929	1	1	1	this procedure is not very specific in its description . for one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples . it does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample . it also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for .
930	1	1	1	after ending this groups procedure i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container . they should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up we we are going to replicate their procedure .
931	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they poured on the three samples the size of the samples and the size of the containers . we would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did .
932	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers . i would also need to know how much of each sample i would need to get before testing lastly i would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results .
933	1	2	2	the group was not very specific in their procedures . in step they say determine mass of four different samples . samples of what they never say . they also say to let it sit for hours where should it sit in the light or dark if i were to follow the procedure the group wrote i would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing .
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis . this is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with . you would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams .
935	1	3	3	we would need to know how much vinegar to use in each containers also what type of container should be used and if we re using pure vinegar or if its a solution . lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the hours .
936	1	3	3	i would trusted to know where is being tested another word the specie materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment .
937	1	1	1	some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed . the other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over .
938	1	2	2	to replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different . also you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in and the outer temperature where you let them sit for hours .
939	1	2	2	in order to replicate this experiment there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object . the word sample should be more specific so it s absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers . lastly there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container .
940	1	3	3	after reading the groups procedure i would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment . first i would need to know what type of material is being used . another thing i would need to know is where to keep the material in sunlight in darkness outside i would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup .
941	1	1	1	are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they measure the samples again now much vinegar they used and what progress the samples made in between .
942	1	0	0	in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table
943	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup . you should also use the same mass as in the original experiment . and you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry .
944	1	1	1	after reading the group s procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of times to do the experiment how long to let the sample sit each cycle and i would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container . also i need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way you can know what your dealing with .
945	1	0	0	in order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples time and containers . so you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects .
946	1	2	2	in the procedure it should include the four samples being massed without this knowledge the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the method they are using to mass the four samples yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment . these changes to the procedure will make the experiment easy for replicate .
947	1	3	3	since the groups procedure is a little vogue in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know some additional information . first you d need to where to let the sample sit and dry because that could make a difference . and you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant . finally you d need to know what are the different samples to use . you know by looking in the data table when they don t list items in the procedure .
948	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid . their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment . and most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow .
949	1	3	2	in order to replicate the groups procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed . with these pieces of information i could more accurately follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results .
950	1	0	0	in the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment . the students listed everything but they didn t give us the time they started . so you will know when to start the hours . so you can drain them and let them come out .
951	1	1	1	i think that if this group that did the acid rain . investigation should of recorded the temp . of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount so they didn t tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry .
952	1	0	0	four different samples p pour vinegar in each p place a sample of one material p after hours allow samples to sit out for min p determine the mass of each sample .
953	1	0	0	you would need what the outcome is after the hours . label what liquid you used for this lab .
954	1	2	2	you would need to know what samples you would need to use . how much vinegar to put in the container say if there was any repeating the trial .
955	1	2	2	after reading the troops procedure some information i would add is how much vinegar to put in the cup i would also say that maybe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable .
956	1	3	3	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is . then i would need to know what the three samples are . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use . the amounts are not specified . finally it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be .
957	1	2	2	in order to replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance scale should be used to determine the mass
958	1	2	1	it is necessary to have a constant for each of the four different samples . the consent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples . also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container .
959	1	3	3	after reading the groups procedure there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the experiment . in the procedure the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass . also the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers . last but not the least the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples .
960	1	0	0	to replicate the experiment you will need determine the mass of four different samples . allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes place a sample of one material into one container a label repeat with remain samples placing a single sample into a single container .
961	1	2	2	the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are how much vinegar to pour in to the containers why to rinse the samples out with distilled water what letting the samples sit and dry for minutes does and what i will measure the samples in to find their mass
962	1	1	1	the students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . also to replicate it . i would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container . last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified .
963	1	3	3	the information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers . the size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use . without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment .
964	1	2	2	some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container . you need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples .
965	1	3	3	i would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on . i would also need to know the problem to this experiment . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment .
966	1	1	1	in my opinion they should add more information of the temperature because different samples might react differently in lower or higher temperature . they should do more than just one try with each sample it should be at least to get a better data they should have measure mass much more often as well .
967	1	3	3	in order to replicate this i would need to know what the samples this are testing for so you don t know what to test . also around how much of the samples do you need g or g or g . also how much vinegar to pour into each container . they must should be specific . they could have also added what to measure in grams kg lo etc . they should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in light dark warm cold .
968	1	2	2	there are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment . first we need to know how much vinegar to add in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given . what size and configuration should the containers be it says identical but does not specify anything else . thirdly how do we determine the mass of the samples
969	1	0	0	at least three pieces of information i would need to replicate this experiment is what safety equipment should i wear the exact way to extract the samples from their containers what do i need to determine the mass of each sample
970	1	3	2	first at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there . in step you need to be told how much vinegar to pour . in step it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry . then in step once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples .
971	1	3	3	you would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use . the size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment .
972	1	2	2	the additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples .
973	1	3	3	in order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information . one piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container . you also need to know what the conditions are made out of . the last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container .
974	1	0	0	i dont think i would add any additional information the procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational .
975	1	3	3	to replicate the experiment i would have to know the size of its containers i use . also i would need to know how much vinegar they poured in . lastly what is the sample material that a major part of the experiment .
976	1	1	0	in order to be able to recreate this experiment i would need to know what is in the cups . i am assuming that it was same type of acid because the marble lost g the limestone lost . g and the plastic lost g . the acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials and different acids have different rates of corrosion so i would need to know what acid acid and its ph in order to recreate this experiment
977	1	3	3	to replicate the experiment a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample . they would also need to know what containers they used . a person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment .
978	1	0	2	this experiment would need a lot more information for it to be repeated . it will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables . understanding that there needs to be a consistent amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment . it is also important that the materials are the same shape and size so they have the same surface to volume ratio .
979	1	2	2	without the table a lot wouldn t be known by looking just at the procedure . first in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of . second you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers . lastly in order to replicate the experiment the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials . it would also help if it was specified in the procedure with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials balance . in what unit grams .
980	1	1	1	the procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data . this is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down you can t see the results as well . you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample . you might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings .
981	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material riling without much details the experiment that i would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students .
982	1	3	3	the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be how much vinegar to pour in the containers how big do the samples have to be what should the labels say on them how much water do i use and how long do i rinse for and how do i measure the mass
983	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment the group of students need a control . in warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar . in the first step the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on . also the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples . this additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow .
984	1	3	3	the group of students didn t specify what samples they were referring to . secondly they didn t include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers . they didn t give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step . all of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment .
985	1	0	0	. determine the mass of four different samples . p . instead of pouring vinegar pour a different kind of liquid . p . use three different kind of containers to see what happens . p . after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water . p . allow the samples to sit and dry for min . p . determine the mass of each sample .
986	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time .
987	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . the group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment .
988	1	2	2	if i was to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material . i would also need to know how much vinegar you need and i need to know the size of the cups they are using .
989	1	1	1	to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples and what your determining the mass of . in their procedure it doesn t say how much vinegar they used nor the measuring tool they used . it also doesn t provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of .
990	1	2	2	after reading the groups procedure a few things are missing . i would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment . by having all the mass s the same it would be easier to determine the difference . i would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get . also some information such as how long i should rinse the samples for after the hours would be helpful in the replica of this experiment .
991	1	0	0	if you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you .
992	1	2	2	how much vinegar to use . the temperature the experiment was conducted under . how much of such sample should be used .
993	1	1	1	say the amount of vinegar put into each cup how do you determine the mass and
994	1	1	1	how much vinegar do you pour in the four containers .
995	1	3	3	in this procedure the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used . all this information is needed to replicate the experiment .
996	1	1	1	in order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it s the same amount for each . in order for the experiment to be replicated the students need to do or more trials for each to gain reply billy . you also need have a control which would be one of each placed in distilled water . the mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn t a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material .
997	1	3	1	how much basis was used in each container rinse with distilled water for how long . how much the container have to be .
998	1	2	2	one piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container . another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same . one more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers .
999	1	2	2	they need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independent variable . they also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable . knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid . another thing is they don t mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar . this is needed for comparison . a control one with just pure water is needed to increase validity .
1000	1	0	1	additional information you would need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup you should also know if all the materials are close in size .
1001	1	1	1	in these procedure it s not explained what this sample is that there putting in . so if we knew exactly what is was it would help . there should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar . the last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use .
1002	1	2	2	after reading this procedure the students could add the amount of vinegar in number that you would pour into the different containers . another thing the students forgot was the different samples what are they they need to include marble limestone wood and plastic into the first step . the last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end .
1003	1	3	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container i would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and i would also need to know the size of each container .
1004	1	2	2	one would need to know mary things in order to replicate the group s procedure . we would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves .
1005	1	3	2	first the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container . also the group should use a control in this experiment . to replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what conditions the samples an the vinegar will be in . we would need to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference .
1006	1	3	3	in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into .
1007	1	3	3	we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . it would also be helpful to know the size of the container size of the sample to use . the process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information .
1008	1	1	1	the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar how you need in order to perform the experiment . also it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need .
1009	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much mass of each sample i would need . i would also need to know what i should use in order to calculate the masses . another thing i would need to know is what material i am massing they dont tell you any of that in the procedure . i also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment but if the same amount isn t used each time then it won t be a control .
1010	1	2	2	in order to replicate the groups experiments i m going to need to know how much vinegar i need and how large of containers i need .
1011	1	2	2	additional information that i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used . and i would also need to know what shape the samples are .
1012	1	1	1	the students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups . how much of the material they will to put into the containers . use the same amount of mass for each object .
1013	1	2	2	the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material .
1014	1	2	2	for this experiment to be replicate there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the different materials . also what would those materials be . it never states what materials to use . how much vinegar should be poured into cup p should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things . there also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water .
1015	1	2	2	after reading the procedure additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers . explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used .
1016	1	1	1	in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i am putting into the four containers .
1017	1	0	2	. one thing that could be added to the pro clever is that you could try using another liquid rather than vinegar . . another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be stone types plastics and woods . . instead of rinsing each sample after hours you could measure the mass with the vinegar and then rinse it off and measure without the vinegar .
1018	1	0	0	the additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass which sample had the least . an explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1019	1	0	0	repeat step p round this data for the nd trial p compare the trials and find the average mass for the four samples . p observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment .
1020	1	0	0	additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure write you need to make a data table to record information form a hypothesis and you would need a control .
1021	1	2	2	. what are the four different samples p . how much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample p . how are you going to measure the mass
1022	1	2	1	to replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers there needs to be a control and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved .
1023	1	1	1	they have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment . p they have to measure the amount of vinegar . p they have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples .
1024	1	2	2	in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that wasn t involved that is needed . first in the product it just said pour vinegar . it didn t say how much which is important . another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deep in in steps it just said let it dry for minutes to didn not sadat what temperature . finally when step says mix with distilled water it doesn t say what temperature the distilled water has it just says distilled water . i would need to know at what temperature distilled water has to be .
1025	1	3	3	i would first need to know what material the samples know and i would need to know how much vinegar . i would also need to know how big each sample should be . also how big the container would be .
1026	1	1	1	the information that i would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used . the other thing i would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with which is the starting mass . last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment .
